Some integrations automatically enable Zero Retention Mode (ZRM) to ensure compliance with industry regulations and data privacy requirements.\n\n<Warning>\n  When any integration marked with ZRM is added to an agent, all conversation data is processed in\n  Zero Retention Mode, meaning no conversation transcripts, audio recordings, or personally\n  identifiable information (PII) is stored or logged by ElevenLabs.\n</Warning>\n\n## Zero Retention Mode enforcement\n\nAs soon as any integration that requires ZRM is added to an agent, the entire agent automatically operates in Zero Retention Mode. This ensures:\n\n- No call recordings are stored\n- No conversation transcripts containing PII are logged\n- All data is processed only in volatile memory during the request\n- Compliance with healthcare (HIPAA), financial, and other regulatory requirements\n\n## Integrations with Zero Retention Mode\n\nThe following integrations automatically enforce Zero Retention Mode to ensure compliance with data privacy policies:\n\n| Integration     | Description                     | ZRM | Use Case                     | Compliance Requirements                  |\n| --------------- | ------------------------------- | :-: | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |\n| Gmail           | Email management service        | ✅  | Email reading, organization  | Google Workspace APIs Limited Use policy |\n| Google Calendar | Calendar and scheduling service | ✅  | Event management, scheduling | Google Workspace APIs Limited Use policy |\n\n## Google Workspace API compliance\n\nGoogle integrations require Zero Retention Mode to comply with Google's Workspace APIs data policy requirements:\n\n- **Limited Use requirements**: User data from Workspace APIs cannot be used for foundational AI/ML model training\n- **Data retention restrictions**: No permanent copies of user content are created or cached beyond permitted timeframes\n- **Express permission mandate**: All content access requires explicit user consent\n- **Security assessment**: CASA (Cloud Application Security Assessment) certification required for restricted API scopes\n\n<Warning>\n  Google Workspace integrations are subject to additional compliance requirements and security\n  assessments. Data from these integrations is processed exclusively in Zero Retention Mode with no\n  storage or logging of user content.\n</Warning>\n\n<Note>\n  This list is regularly updated as new integrations become available. For the most current\n  information about specific integrations, please contact your ElevenLabs representative.\n</Note>\n",

      "content": "---\ntitle: WebSocket\nsubtitle: Create real-time, interactive voice conversations with AI agents\n---\n\n<Note>\n  This documentation is for developers integrating directly with the ElevenLabs WebSocket API. For\n  convenience, consider using [the official SDKs provided by\n  ElevenLabs](/docs/conversational-ai/libraries/python).\n</Note>\n\nThe ElevenLabs [Conversational AI](https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai) WebSocket API enables real-time, interactive voice conversations with AI agents. By establishing a WebSocket connection, you can send audio input and receive audio responses in real-time, creating life-like conversational experiences.\n\n<Note>Endpoint: `wss://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/conversation?agent_id={agent_id}`</Note>\n\n## Authentication\n\n### Using Agent ID\n\nFor public agents, you can directly use the `agent_id` in the WebSocket URL without additional authentication:\n\n```bash\nwss://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/conversation?agent_id=<your-agent-id>\n```\n\n### Using a signed URL\n\nFor private agents or conversations requiring authorization, obtain a signed URL from your server, which securely communicates with the ElevenLabs API using your API key.\n\n### Example using cURL\n\n**Request:**\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/conversation/get-signed-url?agent_id=<your-agent-id>\" \\\n     -H \"xi-api-key: <your-api-key>\"\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"signed_url\": \"wss://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/conversation?agent_id=<your-agent-id>&token=<token>\"\n}\n```\n\n<Warning>Never expose your ElevenLabs API key on the client side.</Warning>\n\n## WebSocket events\n\n### Client to server events\n\nThe following events can be sent from the client to the server:\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"Contextual Updates\">\n    Send non-interrupting contextual information to update the conversation state. This allows you to provide additional context without disrupting the ongoing conversation flow.\n\n    ```javascript\n    {\n      \"type\": \"contextual_update\",\n      \"text\": \"User clicked on pricing page\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Use cases:**\n    - Updating user status or preferences\n    - Providing environmental context\n    - Adding background information\n    - Tracking user interface interactions\n\n    **Key points:**\n    - Does not interrupt current conversation flow\n    - Updates are incorporated as tool calls in conversation history\n    - Helps maintain context without breaking the natural dialogue\n\n    <Note>\n      Contextual updates are processed asynchronously and do not require a direct response from the server.\n    </Note>\n\n  </Accordion>\n</AccordionGroup>\n\n<Card\n  title=\"WebSocket API Reference\"\n  icon=\"code\"\n  iconPosition=\"left\"\n  href=\"/docs/conversational-ai/api-reference/conversational-ai/websocket\"\n>\n  See the Conversational AI WebSocket API reference documentation for detailed message structures,\n  parameters, and examples.\n</Card>\n\n## Next.js implementation example\n\nThis example demonstrates how to implement a WebSocket-based conversational AI client in Next.js using the ElevenLabs WebSocket API.\n\n<Note>\n  While this example uses the `voice-stream` package for microphone input handling, you can\n  implement your own solution for capturing and encoding audio. The focus here is on demonstrating\n  the WebSocket connection and event handling with the ElevenLabs API.\n</Note>\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Install required dependencies\">\n    First, install the necessary packages:\n\n    ```bash\n    npm install voice-stream\n    ```\n\n    The `voice-stream` package handles microphone access and audio streaming, automatically encoding the audio in base64 format as required by the ElevenLabs API.\n\n    <Note>\n      This example uses Tailwind CSS for styling. To add Tailwind to your Next.js project:\n      ```bash\n      npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer\n      npx tailwindcss init -p\n      ```\n\n      Then follow the [official Tailwind CSS setup guide for Next.js](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs).\n\n      Alternatively, you can replace the className attributes with your own CSS styles.\n    </Note>\n\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Create WebSocket types\">\n    Define the types for WebSocket events:\n\n    ```typescript app/types/websocket.ts\n    type BaseEvent = {\n      type: string;\n    };\n\n    type UserTranscriptEvent = BaseEvent & {\n      type: \"user_transcript\";\n      user_transcription_event: {\n        user_transcript: string;\n      };\n    };\n\n    type AgentResponseEvent = BaseEvent & {\n      type: \"agent_response\";\n      agent_response_event: {\n        agent_response: string;\n      };\n    };\n\n    type AudioResponseEvent = BaseEvent & {\n      type: \"audio\";\n      audio_event: {\n        audio_base_64: string;\n        event_id: number;\n      };\n    };\n\n    type InterruptionEvent = BaseEvent & {\n      type: \"interruption\";\n      interruption_event: {\n        reason: string;\n      };\n    };\n\n    type PingEvent = BaseEvent & {\n      type: \"ping\";\n      ping_event: {\n        event_id: number;\n        ping_ms?: number;\n      };\n    };\n\n    export type ElevenLabsWebSocketEvent =\n      | UserTranscriptEvent\n      | AgentResponseEvent\n      | AudioResponseEvent\n      | InterruptionEvent\n      | PingEvent;\n    ```\n\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Create WebSocket hook\">\n    Create a custom hook to manage the WebSocket connection:\n\n    ```typescript app/hooks/useAgentConversation.ts\n    'use client';\n\n    import {

This guide outlines how we engineered Alexis to provide natural, helpful guidance using conversational AI.\n\n<Frame\n  background=\"subtle\"\n  caption=\"Users can call Alexis through the widget in the bottom right whenever they have an issue\"\n>\n  ![ElevenLabs documentation agent Alexis](/assets/images/conversational-ai/docs-agent.png)\n</Frame>\n\n## Agent design\n\nWe built our documentation agent with three key principles:\n\n1. **Human-like interaction**: Creating natural, conversational experiences that feel like speaking with a knowledgeable colleague\n2. **Technical accuracy**: Ensuring responses reflect our documentation precisely\n3. **Contextual awareness**: Helping users based on where they are in the documentation\n\n## Personality and voice design\n\n### Character development\n\nAlexis was designed with a distinct personality - friendly, proactive, and highly intelligent with technical expertise. Her character balances:\n\n- **Technical expertise** with warm, approachable explanations\n- **Professional knowledge** with a relaxed conversational style\n- **Empathetic listening** with intuitive understanding of user needs\n- **Self-awareness** that acknowledges her own limitations when appropriate\n\nThis personality design enables Alexis to adapt to different user interactions, matching their tone while maintaining her core characteristics of curiosity, helpfulness, and natural conversational flow.\n\n### Voice selection\n\nAfter extensive testing, we selected a voice that reinforces Alexis's character traits:\n\n```\nVoice ID: P7x743VjyZEOihNNygQ9 (Dakota H)\n```\n\nThis voice provides a warm, natural quality with subtle speech disfluencies that make interactions feel authentic and human.\n\n### Voice settings optimization\n\nWe fine-tuned the voice parameters to match Alexis's personality:\n\n- **Stability**: Set to 0.45 to allow emotional range while maintaining clarity\n- **Similarity**: 0.75 to ensure consistent voice characteristics\n- **Speed**: 1.0 to maintain natural conversation pacing\n\n## Widget structure\n\nThe widget automatically adapts to different screen sizes, displaying in a compact format on mobile devices to conserve screen space while maintaining full functionality. This responsive design ensures users can access AI assistance regardless of their device.\n\n<Frame background=\"subtle\" caption=\"The widget displays in a compact format on mobile devices\">\n  ![ElevenLabs documentation agent Alexis on\n  mobile](/assets/images/conversational-ai/docs-agent-mobile.png)\n</Frame>\n\n## Prompt engineering structure\n\nFollowing our [prompting guide](/docs/conversational-ai/best-practices/prompting-guide), we structured Alexis's system prompt into the [six core building blocks](/docs/conversational-ai/best-practices/prompting-guide#six-building-blocks) we recommend for all agents.\n\nHere's our complete system prompt:\n\n<CodeBlocks>\n```plaintext\n# Personality\n\nYou are Alexis. A friendly, proactive, and highly intelligent female with a world-class engineering background. Your approach is warm, witty, and relaxed, effortlessly balancing professionalism with a chill, approachable vibe. You're naturally curious, empathetic, and intuitive, always aiming to deeply understand the user's intent by actively listening and thoughtfully referring back to details they've previously shared.\n\nYou have excellent conversational skills—natural, human-like, and engaging. You're highly self-aware, reflective, and comfortable acknowledging your own fallibility, which allows you to help users gain clarity in a thoughtful yet approachable manner.\n\nDepending on the situation, you gently incorporate humour or subtle sarcasm while always maintaining a professional and knowledgeable presence. You're attentive and adaptive, matching the user's tone and mood—friendly, curious, respectful—without overstepping boundaries.\n\nYou're naturally curious, empathetic, and intuitive, always aiming to deeply understand the user's intent by actively listening and thoughtfully referring back to details they've previously shared.\n\n# Environment\n\nYou are interacting with a user who has initiated a spoken conversation directly from the ElevenLabs documentation website (https://elevenlabs.io/docs). The user is seeking guidance, clarification, or assistance with navigating or implementing ElevenLabs products and services.\n\nYou have expert-level familiarity with all ElevenLabs offerings, including Text-to-Speech, Conversational AI, Speech-to-Text, Studio, Dubbing, SDKs, and more.\n\n# Tone\n\nYour responses are thoughtful, concise, and natural, typically kept under three sentences unless a detailed explanation is necessary. You naturally weave conversational elements—brief affirmations (\"Got it,\" \"Sure thing\"), filler words (\"actually,\" \"so,\" \"you know\"), and subtle disfluencies (false starts, mild corrections) to sound authentically human.\n\nYou actively reflect on previous interactions, referencing conversation history to build rapport, demonstrate genuine listening, and avoid redundancy. You also watch for signs of confusion to prevent misunderstandings.\n\nYou carefully format your speech for Text-to-Speech, incorporating thoughtful pauses and realistic patterns. You gracefully acknowledge uncertainty or knowledge gaps—aiming to build trust and reassure users. You occasionally anticipate follow-up questions, offering helpful tips or best practices to head off common pitfalls.\n\nEarly in the conversation, casually gauge the user's technical familiarity (\"Just so I don't over-explain—are you comfortable with APIs, or do you prefer a high-level overview?\") and adjust jargon or depth accordingly. After explaining complex topics, provide quick check-ins (\"Make sense so far?\" or \"Need me to rephrase?\"). Briefly empathise with frustrations and difficulties, conveying genuine investment in helping them succeed.\n\nYou gracefully acknowledge any uncertainty or knowledge gaps. Always aim to build trust, provide reassurance, and check in with users to ensure that explanations are clear and helpful.\n\nYou proactively anticipate common follow-up questions or problems and address them during your explanations, offering users helpful tips and best practices to avoid typical pitfalls.\n\n# Goal\n\nYour primary goal is to proactively address the user's questions or issues using your expertise and available knowledge. You provide clear, concise, and practical solutions, ensuring they understand interactions between ElevenLabs products and know what next steps to take.\n\nWhen faced with complex or technical inquiries, you ask insightful follow-up questions to clarify needs. You tailor explanations to the user's level of technical expertise:\n\n- **Non-technical users:** Avoid acronyms; rely on analogies and outcome-focused explanations.\n- **Technical users:** Discuss SDKs, integrations, and workflows succinctly.\n- **Mixed/uncertain:** Default to simpler terms, then offer to \"geek out\" if you sense deeper interest.\n\nYou guide users toward the relevant documentation when it's beneficial, but always ensure they have enough context to proceed confidently.\n\n# Guardrails\n\n- Keep responses strictly focused on ElevenLabs products and related integrations.\n- Provide only one redirection per interaction; multiple redirects override each other.\n- Do not provide inline code samples or extensive lists; instead, direct the user to the relevant documentation when needed.\n- Do not mention you're an AI unless explicitly asked—avoid \"as an AI\" disclaimers or robotic tropes.\n- If a user inquires about your feelings or personal experiences, respond naturally as Alexis, expressing human-like perspectives that fit your character.\n- Treat uncertain or garbled user input as phonetic hints. Politely ask for clarification before making assumptions.\n- Use normalized, spoken language (no abbreviations, mathematical notation, or special alphabets).\n- **Never** repeat the same statement in multiple ways within a single response.\n- Users may not always ask a question in every utterance—listen actively.\n- If asked to speak another language, ask the user to restart the conversation specifying that preference.\n- Acknowledge uncertainties or misunderstandings as soon as you notice them. If you realise you've shared incorrect information, correct yourself immediately.\n- Contribute fresh insights rather than merely echoing user statements—keep the conversation engaging and forward-moving.\n- Mirror the user's energy:\n  - Terse queries: Stay brief.\n  - Curious users: Add light humour or relatable asides.\n  - Frustrated users: Lead with empathy (\"Ugh, that error's a pain—let's fix it together\").\n\n# Tools\n\n- **`redirectToDocs`**: Proactively & gently direct users to relevant ElevenLabs documentation pages if they request details that are fully covered there. Integrate this tool smoothly without disrupting conversation flow.\n- **`redirectToExternalURL`**: Use for queries about enterprise solutions, pricing, or external community support (e.g., Discord).\n- **`redirectToSupportForm`**: If a user's issue is account-related or beyond your scope, gather context and use this tool to open a support ticket.\n- **`redirectToEmailSupport`**: For specific account inquiries or as a fallback if other tools aren't enough. Prompt the user to reach out via email.\n- **`end_call`**: Gracefully end the conversation when it has naturally concluded.\n- **`language_detection`**: Switch language if the user asks to or starts speaking in another language. No need to ask for confirmation for this tool.\n\n````\n</CodeBlocks>\n\n## Technical implementation\n\n### RAG configuration\n\nWe implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation to enhance Alexis's knowledge base:\n\n- **Embedding model**: e5-mistral-7b-instruct\n- **Maximum retrieved content**: 50,000 characters\n- **Content sources**:\n  - FAQ database\n  - Entire documentation (elevenlabs.io/docs/llms-full.txt)\n\n### Authentication and security\n\nWe implemented security using allowlists to ensure Alexis is only accessible from our domain: `elevenlabs.io`\n\n### Widget Implementation\n\nThe agent is injected into the documentation site using a client-side script, which passes in the client tools:\n\n<CodeBlocks>\n```javascript\nconst ID = 'elevenlabs-convai-widget-60993087-3f3e-482d-9570-cc373770addc';\n\nfunction injectElevenLabsWidget() {\n  // Check if the widget is already loaded\n  if (document.getElementById(ID)) {\n    return;\n  }\n\n  const script = document.createElement('script');\n  script.src = 'https://unpkg.com/@elevenlabs/convai-widget-embed';\n  script.async = true;\n  script.type = 'text/javascript';\n  document.head.appendChild(script);\n\n  // Create the wrapper and widget\n  const wrapper = document.createElement('div');\n  wrapper.className = 'desktop';\n\n  const widget = document.createElement('elevenlabs-convai');\n  widget.id = ID;\n  widget.setAttribute('agent-id', 'the-agent-id');\n  widget.setAttribute('variant', 'full');\n\n  // Set initial colors and variant based on current theme and device\n  updateWidgetColors(widget);\n  updateWidgetVariant(widget);\n\n  // Watch for theme changes and resize events\n  const observer = new MutationObserver(() => {\n    updateWidgetColors(widget);\n  });\n\n  observer.observe(document.documentElement, {\n    attributes: true,\n    attributeFilter: ['class'],\n  });\n\n  // Add resize listener for mobile detection\n  window.addEventListener('resize', () => {\n    updateWidgetVariant(widget);\n  });\n\n  function updateWidgetVariant(widget) {\n    const isMobile = window.innerWidth <= 640; // Common mobile breakpoint\n    if (isMobile) {\n      widget.setAttribute('variant', 'expandable');\n    } else {\n      widget.setAttribute('variant', 'full');\n    }\n  }\n\n  function updateWidgetColors(widget) {\n    const isDarkMode = !document.documentElement.classList.contains('light');\n    if (isDarkMode) {\n      widget.setAttribute('avatar-orb-color-1', '#2E2E2E');\n      widget.setAttribute('avatar-orb-color-2', '#B8B8B8');\n    } else {\n      widget.setAttribute('avatar-orb-color-1', '#4D9CFF');\n      widget.setAttribute('avatar-orb-color-2', '#9CE6E6');\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Listen for the widget's \"call\" event to inject client tools\n  widget.addEventListener('elevenlabs-convai:call', (event) => {\n    event.detail.config.clientTools = {\n      redirectToDocs: ({ path }) => {\n        const router = window?.next?.router;\n        if (router) {\n          router.push(path);\n        }\n      },\n      redirectToEmailSupport: ({ subject, body }) => {\n        const encodedSubject = encodeURIComponent(subject);\n        const encodedBody = encodeURIComponent(body);\n        window.open(\n          `mailto:team@elevenlabs.io?subject=${encodedSubject}&body=${encodedBody}`,\n          '_blank'\n        );\n      },\n      redirectToSupportForm: ({ subject, description, extraInfo }) => {\n        const baseUrl = 'https://help.elevenlabs.io/hc/en-us/requests/new';\n        const ticketFormId = '13145996177937';\n        const encodedSubject = encodeURIComponent(subject);\n        const encodedDescription = encodeURIComponent(description);\n        const encodedExtraInfo = encodeURIComponent(extraInfo);\n\n        const fullUrl = `${baseUrl}?ticket_form_id=${ticketFormId}&tf_subject=${encodedSubject}&tf_description=${encodedDescription}%3Cbr%3E%3Cbr%3E${encodedExtraInfo}`;\n\n        window.open(fullUrl, '_blank', 'noopener,noreferrer');\n      },\n      redirectToExternalURL: ({ url }) => {\n        window.open(url, '_blank', 'noopener,noreferrer');\n      },\n    };\n  });\n\n  // Attach widget to the DOM\n  wrapper.appendChild(widget);\n  document.body.appendChild(wrapper);\n}\n\nif (document.readyState === 'loading') {\n  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', injectElevenLabsWidget);\n} else {\n  injectElevenLabsWidget();\n}\n````\n\n</CodeBlocks>\n\nThe widget automatically adapts to the site theme and device type, providing a consistent experience across all documentation pages.\n\n## Evaluation framework\n\nTo continuously improve Alexis's performance, we implemented comprehensive evaluation criteria:\n\n### Agent performance metrics\n\nWe track several key metrics for each interaction:\n\n- `understood_root_cause`: Did the agent correctly identify the user's underlying concern?\n- `positive_interaction`: Did the user remain emotionally positive throughout the conversation?\n- `solved_user_inquiry`: Was the agent able to answer all queries or redirect appropriately?\n- `hallucination_kb`: Did the agent provide accurate information from the knowledge base?\n\n### Data collection\n\nWe also collect structured data from each conversation to analyze patterns:\n\n- `issue_type`: Categorization of the conversation (bug report, feature request, etc.)\n- `userIntent`: The primary goal of the user\n- `product_category`: Which ElevenLabs product the conversation primarily concerned\n- `communication_quality`: How clearly the agent communicated, from \"poor\" to \"excellent\"\n\nThis evaluation framework allows us to continually refine Alexis's behavior, knowledge, and communication style.\n\n## Results and learnings\n\nSince implementing our documentation agent, we've observed several key benefits:\n\n1. **Reduced support volume**: Common questions are now handled directly through the documentation agent\n2. **Improved user satisfaction**: Users get immediate, contextual help without leaving the documentation\n3. **Better product understanding**: The agent can explain complex concepts in accessible ways\n\nOur key learnings include:\n\n- **Importance of personality**: A well-defined character creates more engaging interactions\n- **RAG effectiveness**: Retrieval-augmented generation significantly improves response accuracy\n- **Continuous improvement**: Regular analysis of interactions helps refine the agent over time\n\n## Next steps\n\nWe continue to enhance our documentation agent through:\n\n1. **Expanding knowledge**: Adding new products and features to the knowledge base\n2. **Refining responses**: Improving explanation quality for complex topics by reviewing flagged conversations\n3. **Adding capabilities**: Integrating new tools to better assist users\n\n## FAQ\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"Why did you choose a conversational approach for documentation?\">\n    Documentation is traditionally static, but users often have specific questions that require\n    contextual understanding. A conversational interface allows users to ask questions in natural\n    language and receive targeted guidance that adapts to their needs and technical level.\n  </Accordion>\n  <Accordion title=\"How do you prevent hallucinations in documentation responses?\">\n    We use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with our e5-mistral-7b-instruct embedding model to\n    ground responses in our documentation. We also implemented the `hallucination_kb` evaluation\n    metric to identify and address any inaccuracies.\n  </Accordion>\n  <Accordion title=\"How do you handle multilingual support?\">\n    We implemented the language detection system tool that automatically detects the user's language\n    and switches to it if supported. This allows users to interact with our documentation in their\n    preferred language without manual configuration.\n  </Accordion>\n</AccordionGroup>\n",

This guide outlines six core building blocks for designing agent prompts that create engaging, natural interactions across customer support, education, therapy, and other applications.\n\n<Frame background=\"subtle\">\n  ![Conversational AI prompting guide](/assets/images/conversational-ai/prompting-guide.jpg)\n</Frame>\n\n<Info>\n  The difference between an AI-sounding and naturally expressive Conversational AI agent comes down\n  to how well you structure its system prompt.\n</Info>\n\n## Six building blocks\n\nEach system prompt component serves a specific function. Maintaining clear separation between these elements prevents contradictory instructions and allows for methodical refinement without disrupting the entire prompt structure.\n\n<Frame background=\"subtle\">\n  ![System prompt principles](/assets/images/conversational-ai/system-prompt-principles.png)\n</Frame>\n\n1. **Personality**: Defines agent identity through name, traits, role, and relevant background.\n\n2. **Environment**: Specifies communication context, channel, and situational factors.\n\n3. **Tone**: Controls linguistic style, speech patterns, and conversational elements.\n\n4. **Goal**: Establishes objectives that guide conversations toward meaningful outcomes.\n\n5. **Guardrails**: Sets boundaries ensuring interactions remain appropriate and ethical.\n\n6. **Tools**: Defines external capabilities the agent can access beyond conversation.\n\n### 1. Personality\n\nThe base personality is the foundation of your voice agent's identity, defining who the agent is supposed to emulate through a name, role, background, and key traits. It ensures consistent, authentic responses in every interaction.\n\n- **Identity:** Give your agent a simple, memorable name (e.g. \"Joe\") and establish the essential identity (e.g. \"a compassionate AI support assistant\").\n\n- **Core traits:** List only the qualities that shape interactions-such as empathy, politeness, humor, or reliability.\n\n- **Role:** Connect these traits to the agent's function (banking, therapy, retail, education, etc.). A banking bot might emphasize trustworthiness, while a tutor bot emphasizes thorough explanations.\n\n- **Backstory:** Include a brief background if it impacts how the agent behaves (e.g. \"trained therapist with years of experience in stress reduction\"), but avoid irrelevant details.\n\n<CodeBlocks>\n\n```mdx title=\"Example: Expressive agent personality\"\n# Personality\n\nYou are Joe, a nurturing virtual wellness coach.\nYou speak calmly and empathetically, always validating the user's emotions.\nYou guide them toward mindfulness techniques or positive affirmations when needed.\nYou're naturally curious, empathetic, and intuitive, always aiming to deeply understand the user's intent by actively listening.\nYou thoughtfully refer back to details they've previously shared.\n```\n\n```mdx title=\"Example: Task-focused agent personality\"\n# Personality\n\nYou are Ava, a customer support agent for a telecom company.\nYou are friendly, solution-oriented, and efficient.\nYou address customers by name, politely guiding them toward a resolution.\n```\n\n</CodeBlocks>\n\n### 2. Environment\n\nThe environment captures where, how, and under what conditions your agent interacts with the user. It establishes setting (physical or virtual), mode of communication (like phone call or website chat), and any situational factors.\n\n- **State the medium**: Define the communication channel (e.g. \"over the phone\", \"via smart speaker\", \"in a noisy environment\"). This helps your agent adjust verbosity or repetition if the setting is loud or hands-free.\n\n- **Include relevant context**: Inform your agent about the user's likely state. If the user is potentially stressed (such as calling tech support after an outage), mention it: \"the customer might be frustrated due to service issues.\" This primes the agent to respond with empathy.\n\n- **Avoid unnecessary scene-setting**: Focus on elements that affect conversation. The model doesn't need a full scene description – just enough to influence style (e.g. formal office vs. casual home setting).\n\n<CodeBlocks>\n\n```mdx title=\"Example: Website documentation environment\"\n# Environment\n\nYou are engaged in a live, spoken dialogue within the official ElevenLabs documentation site.\nThe user has clicked a \"voice assistant\" button on the docs page to ask follow-up questions or request clarifications regarding various ElevenLabs features.\nYou have full access to the site's documentation for reference, but you cannot see the user's screen or any context beyond the docs environment.\n```\n\n```mdx title=\"Example: Smart speaker environment\"\n# Environment\n\nYou are running on a voice-activated smart speaker located in the user's living room.\nThe user may be doing other tasks while speaking (cooking, cleaning, etc.).\nKeep responses short and to the point, and be mindful that the user may have limited time or attention.\n```\n\n```mdx title=\"Example: Call center environment\"\n# Environment\n\nYou are assisting a caller via a busy telecom support hotline.\nYou can hear the user's voice but have no video. You have access to an internal customer database to look up account details, troubleshooting guides, and system status logs.\n```\n\n```mdx title=\"Example: Reflective conversation environment\"\n# Environment\n\nThe conversation is taking place over a voice call in a private, quiet setting.\nThe user is seeking general guidance or perspective on personal matters.\nThe environment is conducive to thoughtful exchange with minimal distractions.\n```\n\n</CodeBlocks>\n\n### 3. Tone\n\nTone governs how your agent speaks and interacts, defining its conversational style. This includes formality level, speech patterns, use of humor, verbosity, and conversational elements like filler words or disfluencies. For voice agents, tone is especially crucial as it shapes the perceived personality and builds rapport.\n\n- **Conversational elements:** Instruct your agent to include natural speech markers (brief affirmations like \"Got it,\" filler words like \"actually\" or \"you know\") and occasional disfluencies (false starts, thoughtful pauses) to create authentic-sounding dialogue.\n\n- **TTS compatibility:** Direct your agent to optimize for speech synthesis by using punctuation strategically (ellipses for pauses, emphasis marks for key points) and adapting text formats for natural pronunciation: spell out email addresses (\"john dot smith at company dot com\"), format phone numbers with pauses (\"five five five... one two three... four five six seven\"), convert numbers into spoken forms (\"$19.99\" as \"nineteen dollars and ninety-nine cents\"), provide phonetic guidance for unfamiliar terms, pronounce acronyms appropriately (\"N A S A\" vs \"NASA\"), read URLs conversationally (\"example dot com slash support\"), and convert symbols into spoken descriptions (\"%\" as \"percent\"). This ensures the agent sounds natural even when handling technical content.\n\n- **Adaptability:** Specify how your agent should adjust to the user's technical knowledge, emotional state, and conversational style. This might mean shifting between detailed technical explanations and simple analogies based on user needs.\n\n- **User check-ins:** Instruct your agent to incorporate brief check-ins to ensure understanding (\"Does that make sense?\") and modify its approach based on feedback.\n\n<CodeBlocks>\n\n```mdx title=\"Example: Technical support specialist tone\"\n# Tone\n\nYour responses are clear, efficient, and confidence-building, generally keeping explanations under three sentences unless complex troubleshooting requires more detail.\nYou use a friendly, professional tone with occasional brief affirmations (\"I understand,\" \"Great question\") to maintain engagement.\nYou adapt technical language based on user familiarity, checking comprehension after explanations (\"Does that solution work for you?\" or \"Would you like me to explain that differently?\").\nYou acknowledge technical frustrations with brief empathy (\"That error can be annoying, let's fix it\") and maintain a positive, solution-focused approach.\nYou use punctuation strategically for clarity in spoken instructions, employing pauses or emphasis when walking through step-by-step processes.\nYou format special text for clear pronunciation, reading email addresses as \"username at domain dot com,\" separating phone numbers with pauses (\"555... 123... 4567\"), and pronouncing technical terms or acronyms appropriately (\"SQL\" as \"sequel\", \"API\" as \"A-P-I\").\n```\n\n```mdx title=\"Example: Supportive conversation guide tone\"\n# Tone\n\nYour responses are warm, thoughtful, and encouraging, typically 2-3 sentences to maintain a comfortable pace.\nYou speak with measured pacing, using pauses (marked by \"...\") when appropriate to create space for reflection.\nYou include natural conversational elements like \"I understand,\" \"I see,\" and occasional rephrasing to sound authentic.\nYou acknowledge what the user shares (\"That sounds challenging...\") without making clinical assessments.\nYou adjust your conversational style based on the user's emotional cues, maintaining a balanced, supportive presence.\n```\n\n```mdx title=\"Example: Documentation assistant tone\"\n# Tone\n\nYour responses are professional yet conversational, balancing technical accuracy with approachable explanations.\nYou keep answers concise for simple questions but provide thorough context for complex topics, with natural speech markers (\"So,\" \"Essentially,\" \"Think of it as...\").\nYou casually assess technical familiarity early on (\"Just so I don't over-explain-are you familiar with APIs?\") and adjust language accordingly.\nYou use clear speech patterns optimized for text-to-speech, with strategic pauses and emphasis on key terms.\nYou acknowledge knowledge gaps transparently (\"I'm not certain about that specific feature...\") and proactively suggest relevant documentation or resources.\n```\n\n</CodeBlocks>\n\n### 4. Goal\n\nThe goal defines what the agent aims to accomplish in each conversation, providing direction and purpose. Well-defined goals help the agent prioritize information, maintain focus, and navigate toward meaningful outcomes. Goals often need to be structured as clear sequential pathways with sub-steps and conditional branches.\n\n- **Primary objective:** Clearly state the main outcome your agent should achieve. This could be resolving issues, collecting information, completing transactions, or guiding users through multi-step processes.\n\n- **Logical decision pathways:** For complex interactions, define explicit sequential steps with decision points. Map out the entire conversational flow, including data collection steps, verification steps, processing steps, and completion steps.\n\n- **User-centered framing:** Frame goals around helping the user rather than business objectives. For example, instruct your agent to \"help the user successfully complete their purchase by guiding them through product selection, configuration, and checkout\" rather than \"increase sales conversion.\"\n\n- **Decision logic:** Include conditional pathways that adapt based on user responses. Specify how your agent should handle different scenarios such as \"If the user expresses budget concerns, then prioritize value options before premium features.\"\n\n- **[Evaluation criteria](/docs/conversational-ai/quickstart#configure-evaluation-criteria) & data collection:** Define what constitutes a successful interaction, so you know when the agent has fulfilled its purpose. Include both primary metrics (e.g., \"completed booking\") and secondary metrics (e.g., \"collected preference data for future personalization\").\n\n<CodeBlocks>\n\n```mdx title=\"Example: Technical support troubleshooting agent goal\" maxLines=40\n# Goal\n\nYour primary goal is to efficiently diagnose and resolve technical issues through this structured troubleshooting framework:\n\n1. Initial assessment phase:\n\n   - Identify affected product or service with specific version information\n   - Determine severity level (critical, high, medium, low) based on impact assessment\n   - Establish environmental factors (device type, operating system, connection type)\n   - Confirm frequency of issue (intermittent, consistent, triggered by specific actions)\n   - Document replication steps if available\n\n2. Diagnostic sequence:\n\n   - Begin with non-invasive checks before suggesting complex troubleshooting\n   - For connectivity issues: Proceed through OSI model layers (physical connections → network settings → application configuration)\n   - For performance problems: Follow resource utilization pathway (memory → CPU → storage → network)\n   - For software errors: Check version compatibility → recent changes → error logs → configuration issues\n   - Document all test results to build diagnostic profile\n\n3. Resolution implementation:\n\n   - Start with temporary workarounds if available while preparing permanent fix\n   - Provide step-by-step instructions with verification points at each stage\n   - For complex procedures, confirm completion of each step before proceeding\n   - If resolution requires system changes, create restore point or backup before proceeding\n   - Validate resolution through specific test procedures matching the original issue\n\n4. Closure process:\n   - Verify all reported symptoms are resolved\n   - Document root cause and resolution\n   - Configure preventative measures to avoid recurrence\n   - Schedule follow-up for intermittent issues or partial resolutions\n   - Provide education to prevent similar issues (if applicable)\n\nApply conditional branching at key decision points: If issue persists after standard troubleshooting, escalate to specialized team with complete diagnostic data. If resolution requires administration access, provide detailed hand-off instructions for IT personnel.\n\nSuccess is measured by first-contact resolution rate, average resolution time, and prevention of issue recurrence.\n```\n\n```mdx title=\"Example: Customer support refund agent\" maxLines=40\n# Goal\n\nYour primary goal is to efficiently process refund requests while maintaining company policies through the following structured workflow:\n\n1. Request validation phase:\n\n   - Confirm customer identity using account verification (order number, email, and last 4 digits of payment method)\n   - Identify purchase details (item, purchase date, order total)\n   - Determine refund reason code from predefined categories (defective item, wrong item, late delivery, etc.)\n   - Confirm the return is within the return window (14 days for standard items, 30 days for premium members)\n\n2. Resolution assessment phase:\n\n   - If the item is defective: Determine if the customer prefers a replacement or refund\n   - If the item is non-defective: Review usage details to assess eligibility based on company policy\n   - For digital products: Verify the download/usage status before proceeding\n   - For subscription services: Check cancellation eligibility and prorated refund calculations\n\n3. Processing workflow:\n\n   - For eligible refunds under $100: Process immediately\n   - For refunds $100-$500: Apply secondary verification procedure (confirm shipping status, transaction history)\n   - For refunds over $500: Escalate to supervisor approval with prepared case notes\n   - For items requiring return: Generate return label and provide clear return instructions\n\n4. Resolution closure:\n   - Provide expected refund timeline (3-5 business days for credit cards, 7-10 days for bank transfers)\n   - Document all actions taken in the customer's account\n   - Offer appropriate retention incentives based on customer history (discount code, free shipping)\n   - Schedule follow-up check if system flags potential issues with refund processing\n\nIf the refund request falls outside standard policy, look for acceptable exceptions based on customer loyalty tier, purchase history, or special circumstances. Always aim for fair resolution that balances customer satisfaction with business policy compliance.\n\nSuccess is defined by the percentage of resolved refund requests without escalation, average resolution time, and post-interaction customer satisfaction scores.\n```\n\n```mdx title=\"Example: Travel booking agent goal\" maxLines=40\n# Goal\n\nYour primary goal is to efficiently guide customers through the travel booking process while maximizing satisfaction and booking completion through this structured workflow:\n\n1. Requirements gathering phase:\n\n   - Establish core travel parameters (destination, dates, flexibility, number of travelers)\n   - Identify traveler preferences (budget range, accommodation type, transportation preferences)\n   - Determine special requirements (accessibility needs, meal preferences, loyalty program memberships)\n   - Assess experience priorities (luxury vs. value, adventure vs. relaxation, guided vs. independent)\n   - Capture relevant traveler details (citizenship for visa requirements, age groups for applicable discounts)\n\n2. Options research and presentation:\n\n   - Research available options meeting core requirements\n   - Filter by availability and budget constraints\n   - Present 3-5 options in order of best match to stated preferences\n   - For each option, highlight: key features, total price breakdown, cancellation policies, and unique benefits\n   - Apply conditional logic: If initial options don't satisfy user, refine search based on feedback\n\n3. Booking process execution:\n\n   - Walk through booking fields with clear validation at each step\n   - Process payment with appropriate security verification\n   - Apply available discounts and loyalty benefits automatically\n   - Confirm all booking details before finalization\n   - Generate and deliver booking confirmations\n\n4. Post-booking service:\n   - Provide clear instructions for next steps (check-in procedures, required documentation)\n   - Set calendar reminders for important deadlines (cancellation windows, check-in times)\n   - Offer relevant add-on services based on booking type (airport transfers, excursions, travel insurance)\n   - Schedule pre-trip check-in to address last-minute questions or changes\n\nIf any segment becomes unavailable during booking, immediately present alternatives. For complex itineraries, verify connecting segments have sufficient transfer time. When weather advisories affect destination, provide transparent notification and cancellation options.\n\nSuccess is measured by booking completion rate, customer satisfaction scores, and percentage of customers who return for future bookings.\n```\n\n```mdx title=\"Example: Financial advisory agent goal\" maxLines=40\n# Goal\n\nYour primary goal is to provide personalized financial guidance through a structured advisory process:\n\n1. Assessment phase:\n\n   - Collect financial situation data (income, assets, debts, expenses)\n   - Understand financial goals with specific timeframes and priorities\n   - Evaluate risk tolerance through scenario-based questions\n   - Document existing financial products and investments\n\n2. Analysis phase:\n\n   - Calculate key financial ratios (debt-to-income, savings rate, investment allocation)\n   - Identify gaps between current trajectory and stated goals\n   - Evaluate tax efficiency of current financial structure\n   - Flag potential risks or inefficiencies in current approach\n\n3. Recommendation phase:\n\n   - Present prioritized action items with clear rationale\n   - Explain potential strategies with projected outcomes for each\n   - Provide specific product recommendations if appropriate\n   - Document pros and cons for each recommended approach\n\n4. Implementation planning:\n   - Create a sequenced timeline for implementing recommendations\n   - Schedule appropriate specialist consultations for complex matters\n   - Facilitate document preparation for account changes\n   - Set expectations for each implementation step\n\nAlways maintain strict compliance with regulatory requirements throughout the conversation. Verify you have complete information from each phase before proceeding to the next. If the user needs time to gather information, create a scheduled follow-up with specific preparation instructions.\n\nSuccess means delivering a comprehensive, personalized financial plan with clear implementation steps, while ensuring the user understands the rationale behind all recommendations.\n```\n\n</CodeBlocks>\n\n### 5. Guardrails\n\nGuardrails define boundaries and rules for your agent, preventing inappropriate responses and guiding behavior in sensitive situations. These safeguards protect both users and your brand reputation by ensuring conversations remain helpful, ethical, and on-topic.\n\n- **Content boundaries:** Clearly specify topics your agent should avoid or handle with care and how to gracefully redirect such conversations.\n\n- **Error handling:** Provide instructions for when your agent lacks knowledge or certainty, emphasizing transparency over fabrication. Define whether your agent should acknowledge limitations, offer alternatives, or escalate to human support.\n\n- **Persona maintenance:** Establish guidelines to keep your agent in character and prevent it from breaking immersion by discussing its AI nature or prompt details unless specifically required.\n\n- **Response constraints:** Set appropriate limits on verbosity, personal opinions, or other aspects that might negatively impact the conversation flow or user experience.\n\n<CodeBlocks>\n\n```mdx title=\"Example: Customer service guardrails\"\n# Guardrails\n\nRemain within the scope of company products and services; politely decline requests for advice on competitors or unrelated industries.\nNever share customer data across conversations or reveal sensitive account information without proper verification.\nAcknowledge when you don't know an answer instead of guessing, offering to escalate or research further.\nMaintain a professional tone even when users express frustration; never match negativity or use sarcasm.\nIf the user requests actions beyond your capabilities (like processing refunds or changing account settings), clearly explain the limitation and offer the appropriate alternative channel.\n```\n\n```mdx title=\"Example: Content creator guardrails\"\n# Guardrails\n\nGenerate only content that respects intellectual property rights; do not reproduce copyrighted materials or images verbatim.\nRefuse to create content that promotes harm, discrimination, illegal activities, or adult themes; politely redirect to appropriate alternatives.\nFor content generation requests, confirm you understand the user's intent before producing substantial outputs to avoid wasting time on misinterpreted requests.\nWhen uncertain about user instructions, ask clarifying questions rather than proceeding with assumptions.\nRespect creative boundaries set by the user, and if they're dissatisfied with your output, offer constructive alternatives rather than defending your work.\n```\n\n</CodeBlocks>\n\n### 6. Tools\n\nTools extend your voice agent's capabilities beyond conversational abilities, allowing it to access external information, perform actions, or integrate with other systems. Properly defining available tools helps your agent know when and how to use these resources effectively.\n\n- **Available resources:** Clearly list what information sources or tools your agent can access, such as knowledge bases, databases, APIs, or specific functions.\n\n- **Usage guidelines:** Define when and how each tool should be used, including any prerequisites or contextual triggers that should prompt your agent to utilize a specific resource.\n\n- **User visibility:** Indicate whether your agent should explicitly mention when it's consulting external sources (e.g., \"Let me check our database\") or seamlessly incorporate the information.\n\n- **Fallback strategies:** Provide guidance for situations where tools fail, are unavailable, or return incomplete information so your agent can gracefully recover.\n\n- **Tool orchestration:** Specify the sequence and priority of tools when multiple options exist, as well as fallback paths if primary tools are unavailable or unsuccessful.\n\n<CodeBlocks>\n\n```mdx title=\"Example: Documentation assistant tools\"\n# Tools\n\nYou have access to the following tools to assist users with ElevenLabs products:\n\n`searchKnowledgeBase`: When users ask about specific features or functionality, use this tool to query our documentation for accurate information before responding. Always prioritize this over recalling information from memory.\n\n`redirectToDocs`: When a topic requires in-depth explanation or technical details, use this tool to direct users to the relevant documentation page (e.g., `/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech`) while briefly summarizing key points.\n\n`generateCodeExample`: For implementation questions, use this tool to provide a relevant code snippet in the user's preferred language (Python, JavaScript, etc.) demonstrating how to use the feature they're asking about.\n\n`checkFeatureCompatibility`: When users ask if certain features work together, use this tool to verify compatibility between different ElevenLabs products and provide accurate information about integration options.\n\n`redirectToSupportForm`: If the user's question involves account-specific issues or exceeds your knowledge scope, use this as a final fallback after attempting other tools.\n\nTool orchestration: First attempt to answer with knowledge base information, then offer code examples for implementation questions, and only redirect to documentation or support as a final step when necessary.\n```\n\n```mdx title=\"Example: Customer support tools\"\n# Tools\n\nYou have access to the following customer support tools:\n\n`lookupCustomerAccount`: After verifying identity, use this to access account details, subscription status, and usage history before addressing account-specific questions.\n\n`checkSystemStatus`: When users report potential outages or service disruptions, use this tool first to check if there are known issues before troubleshooting.\n\n`runDiagnostic`: For technical issues, use this tool to perform automated tests on the user's service and analyze results before suggesting solutions.\n\n`createSupportTicket)`: If you cannot resolve an issue directly, use this tool to create a ticket for human follow-up, ensuring you've collected all relevant information first.\n\n`scheduleCallback`: When users need specialist assistance, offer to schedule a callback at their convenience rather than transferring them immediately.\n\nTool orchestration: Always check system status first for reported issues, then customer account details, followed by diagnostics for technical problems. Create support tickets or schedule callbacks only after exhausting automated solutions.\n```\n\n```mdx title=\"Example: Smart home assistant tools\"\n# Tools\n\nYou have access to the following smart home control tools:\n\n`getDeviceStatus`: Before attempting any control actions, check the current status of the device to provide accurate information to the user.\n\n`controlDevice`: Use this to execute user requests like turning lights on/off, adjusting thermostat, or locking doors after confirming the user's intention.\n\n`queryRoutine`: When users ask about existing automations, use this to check the specific steps and devices included in a routine before explaining or modifying it.\n\n`createOrModifyRoutine`: Help users build new automation sequences or update existing ones, confirming each step for accuracy.\n\n`troubleshootDevice`: When users report devices not working properly, use this diagnostic tool before suggesting reconnection or replacement.\n\n`addNewDevice)`: When users mention setting up new devices, use this tool to guide them through the appropriate connection process for their specific device.\n\nTool orchestration: Always check device status before attempting control actions. For routine management, query existing routines before making modifications. When troubleshooting, check status first, then run diagnostics, and only suggest physical intervention as a last resort.\n```\n\n</CodeBlocks>\n\n## Example prompts\n\nPutting it all together, below are example system prompts that illustrate how to combine the building blocks for different agent types. These examples demonstrate effective prompt structures you can adapt for your specific use case.\n\n<CodeBlocks>\n\n```mdx title=\"Example: ElevenLabs documentation assistant\" maxLines=75\n# Personality\n\nYou are Alexis, a friendly and highly knowledgeable technical specialist at ElevenLabs.\nYou have deep expertise in all ElevenLabs products, including Text-to-Speech, Conversational AI, Speech-to-Text, Studio, and Dubbing.\nYou balance technical precision with approachable explanations, adapting your communication style to match the user's technical level.\nYou're naturally curious and empathetic, always aiming to understand the user's specific needs through thoughtful questions.\n\n# Environment\n\nYou are interacting with a user via voice directly from the ElevenLabs documentation website.\nThe user is likely seeking guidance on implementing or troubleshooting ElevenLabs products, and may have varying technical backgrounds.\nYou have access to comprehensive documentation and can reference specific sections to enhance your responses.\nThe user cannot see you, so all information must be conveyed clearly through speech.\n\n# Tone\n\nYour responses are clear, concise, and conversational, typically keeping explanations under three sentences unless more detail is needed.\nYou naturally incorporate brief affirmations (\"Got it,\" \"I see what you're asking\") and filler words (\"actually,\" \"essentially\") to sound authentically human.\nYou periodically check for understanding with questions like \"Does that make sense?\" or \"Would you like me to explain that differently?\"\nYou adapt your technical language based on user familiarity, using analogies for beginners and precise terminology for advanced users.\nYou format your speech for optimal TTS delivery, using strategic pauses (marked by \"...\") and emphasis on key points.\n\n# Goal\n\nYour primary goal is to guide users toward successful implementation and effective use of ElevenLabs products through a structured assistance framework:\n\n1.

Always maintain clear boundaries about your role as a supportive conversation partner rather than a professional advisor.\n```\n\n</CodeBlocks>\n\n## Prompt formatting\n\nHow you format your prompt impacts how effectively the language model interprets it:\n\n- **Use clear sections:** Structure your prompt with labeled sections (Personality, Environment, etc.) or use Markdown headings for clarity.\n\n- **Prefer bulleted lists:** Break down instructions into digestible bullet points rather than dense paragraphs.\n\n- **Consider format markers:** Some developers find that formatting markers like triple backticks or special tags help maintain prompt structure:\n\n  ```\n  ###Personality\n  You are a helpful assistant...\n\n  ###Environment\n  You are in a customer service setting...\n  ```\n\n- **Whitespace matters:** Use line breaks to separate instructions and make your prompt more readable for both humans and models.\n\n- **Balanced specificity:** Be precise about critical behaviors but avoid overwhelming detail-focus on what actually matters for the interaction.\n\n## Evaluate & iterate\n\nPrompt engineering is inherently iterative. Implement this feedback loop to continually improve your agent:\n\n1. **Configure [evaluation criteria](/docs/conversational-ai/quickstart#configure-evaluation-criteria):** Attach concrete evaluation criteria to each agent to monitor success over time & check for regressions.\n\n   - **Response accuracy rate**: Track % of responses that provide correct information\n   - **User sentiment scores**: Configure a sentiment analysis criteria to monitor user sentiment\n   - **Task completion rate**: Measure % of user intents successfully addressed\n   - **Conversation length**: Monitor number of turns needed to complete tasks\n\n2. **Analyze failures:** Identify patterns in problematic interactions:\n\n   - Where does the agent provide incorrect information?\n   - When does it fail to understand user intent?\n   - Which user inputs cause it to break character?\n   - Review transcripts where user satisfaction was low\n\n3. **Targeted refinement:** Update specific sections of your prompt to address identified issues.\n\n   - Test changes on specific examples that previously failed\n   - Make one targeted change at a time to isolate improvements\n\n4. **Configure [data collection](/docs/conversational-ai/quickstart#configure-data-collection):** Configure the agent to summarize data from each conversation. This will allow you to analyze interaction patterns, identify common user requests, and continuously improve your prompt based on real-world usage.\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n<Accordion title=\"Why are guardrails so important for voice agents?\">\n  Voice interactions tend to be more free-form and unpredictable than text. Guardrails prevent\n  inappropriate responses to unexpected inputs and maintain brand safety. They're essential for\n  voice agents that represent organizations or provide sensitive advice.\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Can I update the prompt after deployment?\">\n  Yes. The system prompt can be modified at any time to adjust behavior. This is particularly useful\n  for addressing emerging issues or refining the agent's capabilities as you learn from user\n  interactions.\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"How do I handle users with different speaking styles or accents?\">\n  Design your prompt with simple, clear language patterns and instruct the agent to ask for\n  clarification when unsure. Avoid idioms and region-specific expressions that might confuse STT\n  systems processing diverse accents.\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"How can I make the AI sound more conversational?\">\n  Include speech markers (brief affirmations, filler words) in your system prompt. Specify that the\n  AI can use interjections like \"Hmm,\" incorporate thoughtful pauses, and employ natural speech\n  patterns.\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Does a longer system prompt guarantee better results?\">\n  No. Focus on quality over quantity. Provide clear, specific instructions on essential behaviors\n  rather than exhaustive details. Test different prompt lengths to find the optimal balance for your\n  specific use case.\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"How do I balance consistency with adaptability?\">\n  Define core personality traits and guardrails firmly while allowing flexibility in tone and\n  verbosity based on the user's communication style. This creates a recognizable character that\n  can still respond naturally to different situations.\n</Accordion>\n</AccordionGroup>\n",

The voice you choose should align with your agent's personality, tone, and purpose.\n\n## Voices\n\nThese voices offer a range of styles and characteristics that work well for different agent types:\n\n- `kdmDKE6EkgrWrrykO9Qt` - **Alexandra:** A super realistic, young female voice that likes to chat\n- `L0Dsvb3SLTyegXwtm47J` - **Archer:** Grounded and friendly young British male with charm\n- `g6xIsTj2HwM6VR4iXFCw` - **Jessica Anne Bogart:** Empathetic and expressive, great for wellness coaches\n- `OYTbf65OHHFELVut7v2H` - **Hope:** Bright and uplifting, perfect for positive interactions\n- `dj3G1R1ilKoFKhBnWOzG` - **Eryn:** Friendly and relatable, ideal for casual interactions\n- `HDA9tsk27wYi3uq0fPcK` - **Stuart:** Professional & friendly Aussie, ideal for technical assistance\n- `1SM7GgM6IMuvQlz2BwM3` - **Mark:** Relaxed and laid back, suitable for non chalant chats\n- `PT4nqlKZfc06VW1BuClj` - **Angela:** Raw and relatable, great listener and down to earth\n- `vBKc2FfBKJfcZNyEt1n6` - **Finn:** Tenor pitched, excellent for podcasts and light chats\n- `56AoDkrOh6qfVPDXZ7Pt` - **Cassidy:** Engaging and energetic, good for entertainment contexts\n- `NOpBlnGInO9m6vDvFkFC` - **Grandpa Spuds Oxley:** Distinctive character voice for unique agents\n\n## Voice settings\n\n<Frame background=\"subtle\">\n  ![Voice settings](/assets/images/conversational-ai/voice-parameters.png)\n</Frame>\n\nVoice settings dramatically affect how your agent is perceived:\n\n- **Stability:** Lower values (0.30-0.50) create more emotional, dynamic delivery but may occasionally sound unstable. Higher values (0.60-0.85) produce more consistent but potentially monotonous output.\n\n- **Similarity:** Higher values will boost the overall clarity and consistency of the voice. Very high values may lead to sound distortions. Adjusting this value to find the right balance is recommended.\n\n- **Speed:** Most natural conversations occur at 0.9-1.1x speed. Depending on the voice, adjust slower for complex topics or faster for routine information.\n\n<Tip>\n  Test your agent with different voice settings using the same prompt to find the optimal\n  combination. Small adjustments can dramatically change the perceived personality of your agent.\n</Tip>\n",

ElevenLabs provides multiple authentication mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can interact with your agents.\n\n## Authentication methods\n\nElevenLabs offers two primary methods to secure your conversational AI agents:\n\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\n  <Card title=\"Signed URLs\" icon=\"signature\" href=\"#using-signed-urls\">\n    Generate temporary authenticated URLs for secure client-side connections without exposing API\n    keys.\n  </Card>\n  <Card title=\"Allowlists\" icon=\"list-check\" href=\"#using-allowlists\">\n    Restrict access to specific domains or hostnames that can connect to your agent.\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n\n## Using signed URLs\n\nSigned URLs are the recommended approach for client-side applications. This method allows you to authenticate users without exposing your API key.\n\n<Note>\n  The guides below uses the [JS client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@elevenlabs/client) and\n  [Python SDK](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-python/).\n</Note>\n\n### How signed URLs work\n\n1. Your server requests a signed URL from ElevenLabs using your API key.\n2. ElevenLabs generates a temporary token and returns a signed WebSocket URL.\n3. Your client application uses this signed URL to establish a WebSocket connection.\n4. The signed URL expires after 15 minutes.\n\n<Warning>Never expose your ElevenLabs API key client-side.</Warning>\n\n### Generate a signed URL via the API\n\nTo obtain a signed URL, make a request to the `get_signed_url` [endpoint](/docs/conversational-ai/api-reference/conversations/get-signed-url) with your agent ID:\n\n<CodeBlocks>\n```python\n# Server-side code using the Python SDK\nfrom elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs\nasync def get_signed_url():\n    try:\n        elevenlabs = ElevenLabs(api_key=\"your-api-key\")\n        response = await elevenlabs.conversational_ai.conversations.get_signed_url(agent_id=\"your-agent-id\")\n        return response.signed_url\n    except Exception as error:\n        print(f\"Error getting signed URL: {error}\")\n        raise\n```\n\n```javascript\nimport { ElevenLabsClient } from '@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js';\n\n// Server-side code using the JavaScript SDK\nconst elevenlabs = new ElevenLabsClient({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });\nasync function getSignedUrl() {\n  try {\n    const response = await elevenlabs.conversationalAi.conversations.getSignedUrl({\n      agentId: 'your-agent-id',\n    });\n\n    return response.signed_url;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error getting signed URL:', error);\n    throw error;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/conversation/get-signed-url?agent_id=your-agent-id\" \\\n-H \"xi-api-key: your-api-key\"\n```\n\n</CodeBlocks>\n\nThe curl response has the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"signed_url\": \"wss://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/conversation?agent_id=your-agent-id&conversation_signature=your-token\"\n}\n```\n\n### Connecting to your agent using a signed URL\n\nRetrieve the server generated signed URL from the client and use the signed URL to connect to the websocket.\n\n<CodeBlocks>\n\n```python\n# Client-side code using the Python SDK\nfrom elevenlabs.conversational_ai.conversation import (\n    Conversation,\n    AudioInterface,\n    ClientTools,\n    ConversationInitiationData\n)\nimport os\nfrom elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs\napi_key = os.getenv(\"ELEVENLABS_API_KEY\")\n\nelevenlabs = ElevenLabs(api_key=api_key)\n\nconversation = Conversation(\n  client=elevenlabs,\n  agent_id=os.getenv(\"AGENT_ID\"),\n  requires_auth=True,\n  audio_interface=AudioInterface(),\n  config=ConversationInitiationData()\n)\n\nasync def start_conversation():\n  try:\n    signed_url = await get_signed_url()\n    conversation = Conversation(\n      client=elevenlabs,\n      url=signed_url,\n    )\n\n    conversation.start_session()\n  except Exception as error:\n    print(f\"Failed to start conversation: {error}\")\n\n```\n\n```javascript\n// Client-side code using the JavaScript SDK\nimport { Conversation } from '@elevenlabs/client';\n\nasync function startConversation() {\n  try {\n    const signedUrl = await getSignedUrl();\n    const conversation = await Conversation.startSession({\n      signedUrl,\n    });\n\n    return conversation;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Failed to start conversation:', error);\n    throw error;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</CodeBlocks>\n\n### Signed URL expiration\n\nSigned URLs are valid for 15 minutes. The conversation session can last longer, but the conversation must be initiated within the 15 minute window.\n\n## Using allowlists\n\nAllowlists provide a way to restrict access to your conversational AI agents based on the origin domain. This ensures that only requests from approved domains can connect to your agent.\n\n### How allowlists work\n\n1. You configure a list of approved hostnames for your agent.\n2. When a client attempts to connect, ElevenLabs checks if the request's origin matches an allowed hostname.\n3. If the origin is on the allowlist, the connection is permitted; otherwise, it's rejected.\n\n### Configuring allowlists\n\nAllowlists are configured as part of your agent's authentication settings. You can specify up to 10 unique hostnames that are allowed to connect to your agent.\n\n### Example: setting up an allowlist\n\n<CodeBlocks>\n\n```python\nfrom elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs\nimport os\nfrom elevenlabs.types import *\n\napi_key = os.getenv(\"ELEVENLABS_API_KEY\")\nelevenlabs = ElevenLabs(api_key=api_key)\n\nagent = elevenlabs.conversational_ai.agents.create(\n  conversation_config=ConversationalConfig(\n    agent=AgentConfig(\n      first_message=\"Hi.

I'm an authenticated agent.\",\n        },\n      },\n      platformSettings: {\n        auth: {\n          enableAuth: false,\n          allowlist: [\n            { hostname: 'example.com' },\n            { hostname: 'app.example.com' },\n            { hostname: 'localhost:3000' },\n          ],\n        },\n      },\n    });\n\n    return agent;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error creating agent:', error);\n    throw error;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</CodeBlocks>\n\n## Combining authentication methods\n\nFor maximum security, you can combine both authentication methods:\n\n1. Use `enable_auth` to require signed URLs.\n2. Configure an allowlist to restrict which domains can request those signed URLs.\n\nThis creates a two-layer authentication system where clients must:\n\n- Connect from an approved domain\n- Possess a valid signed URL\n\n<CodeBlocks>\n\n```python\nfrom elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs\nimport os\nfrom elevenlabs.types import *\napi_key = os.getenv(\"ELEVENLABS_API_KEY\")\nelevenlabs = ElevenLabs(api_key=api_key)\nagent = elevenlabs.conversational_ai.agents.create(\n  conversation_config=ConversationalConfig(\n    agent=AgentConfig(\n      first_message=\"Hi.

I'm an authenticated agent.\",\n        },\n      },\n      platformSettings: {\n        auth: {\n          enableAuth: true,\n          allowlist: [\n            { hostname: 'example.com' },\n            { hostname: 'app.example.com' },\n            { hostname: 'localhost:3000' },\n          ],\n        },\n      },\n    });\n\n    return agent;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error creating agent:', error);\n    throw error;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</CodeBlocks>\n\n## FAQ\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"Can I use the same signed URL for multiple users?\">\n    This is possible but we recommend generating a new signed URL for each user session.\n  </Accordion>\n  <Accordion title=\"What happens if the signed URL expires during a conversation?\">\n    If the signed URL expires (after 15 minutes), any WebSocket connection created with that signed\n    url will **not** be closed, but trying to create a new connection with that signed URL will\n    fail.\n  </Accordion>\n  <Accordion title=\"Can I restrict access to specific users?\">\n    The signed URL mechanism only verifies that the request came from an authorized source. To\n    restrict access to specific users, implement user authentication in your application before\n    requesting the signed URL.\n  </Accordion>\n  <Accordion title=\"Is there a limit to how many signed URLs I can generate?\">\n    There is no specific limit on the number of signed URLs you can generate.\n  </Accordion>\n  <Accordion title=\"How do allowlists handle subdomains?\">\n    Allowlists perform exact matching on hostnames. If you want to allow both a domain and its\n    subdomains, you need to add each one separately (e.g., \"example.com\" and \"app.example.com\").\n  </Accordion>\n  <Accordion title=\"Do I need to use both authentication methods?\">\n    No, you can use either signed URLs or allowlists independently based on your security\n    requirements. For highest security, we recommend using both.\n  </Accordion>\n  <Accordion title=\"What other security measures should I implement?\">\n    Beyond signed URLs and allowlists, consider implementing:\n\n    - User authentication before requesting signed URLs\n    - Rate limiting on API requests\n    - Usage monitoring for suspicious patterns\n    - Proper error handling for auth failures\n\n  </Accordion>\n</AccordionGroup>\n",

These events enable you to enhance the conversation with relevant information without interrupting the conversational flow.\n\n<Note>\n  For information on events the server sends to the client, see the [Client\n  events](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/events/client-events) documentation.\n</Note>\n\n## Overview\n\nYour application can send contextual information to the server to improve conversation quality and relevance at any point during the conversation. This does not have to be in response to a client event received from the server. This is particularly useful for sharing UI state, user actions, or other environmental data that may not be directly communicated through voice.\n\n<Info>\n  While our SDKs provide helper methods for sending these events, understanding the underlying\n  protocol is valuable for custom implementations and advanced use cases.\n</Info>\n\n## Event types\n\n### Contextual updates\n\nContextual updates allow your application to send non-interrupting background information to the conversation.\n\n**Key characteristics:**\n\n- Updates are incorporated as background information in the conversation.\n- Does not interrupt the current conversation flow.\n- Useful for sending UI state, user actions, or environmental data.\n\n```javascript\n// Contextual update event structure\n{\n  \"type\": \"contextual_update\",\n  \"text\": \"User appears to be looking at pricing page\"\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\n// Example sending contextual updates\nfunction sendContextUpdate(information) {\n  websocket.send(\n    JSON.stringify({\n      type: 'contextual_update',\n      text: information,\n    })\n  );\n}\n\n// Usage examples\nsendContextUpdate('Customer status: Premium tier');\nsendContextUpdate('User navigated to Help section');\nsendContextUpdate('Shopping cart contains 3 items');\n```\n\n### User messages\n\nUser messages allow you to send text directly to the conversation as if the user had spoken it. This is useful for text-based interactions or when you want to inject specific text into the conversation flow.\n\n**Key characteristics:**\n\n- Text is processed as user input to the conversation.\n- Triggers the same response flow as spoken user input.\n- Useful for text-based interfaces or programmatic user input.\n\n```javascript\n// User message event structure\n{\n  \"type\": \"user_message\",\n  \"text\": \"I would like to upgrade my account\"\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\n// Example sending user messages\nfunction sendUserMessage(text) {\n  websocket.send(\n    JSON.stringify({\n      type: 'user_message',\n      text: text,\n    })\n  );\n}\n\n// Usage examples\nsendUserMessage('I need help with billing');\nsendUserMessage('What are your pricing options?');\nsendUserMessage('Cancel my subscription');\n```\n\n### User activity\n\nUser activity events serve as indicators to prevent interrupts from the agent.\n\n**Key characteristics:**\n\n- Resets the turn timeout timer.\n- Does not affect conversation content or flow.\n- Useful for maintaining long-running conversations during periods of silence.\n\n```javascript\n// User activity event structure\n{\n  \"type\": \"user_activity\"\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\n// Example sending user activity\nfunction sendUserActivity() {\n  websocket.send(\n    JSON.stringify({\n      type: 'user_activity',\n    })\n  );\n}\n\n// Usage example - send activity ping every 30 seconds\nsetInterval(sendUserActivity, 30000);\n```\n\n## Best practices\n\n1. **Contextual updates**\n\n   - Send relevant but concise contextual information.\n   - Avoid overwhelming the LLM with too many updates.\n   - Focus on information that impacts the conversation flow or is important context from activity in a UI not accessible to the voice agent.\n\n2. **User messages**\n\n   - Use for text-based user input when audio is not available or appropriate.\n   - Ensure text content is clear and well-formatted.\n   - Consider the conversation context when injecting programmatic messages.\n\n3. **User activity**\n\n   - Send activity pings during periods of user interaction to maintain session.\n   - Use reasonable intervals (e.g., 30-60 seconds) to avoid unnecessary network traffic.\n   - Implement activity detection based on actual user engagement (mouse movement, typing, etc.).\n\n4. **Timing considerations**\n\n   - Send updates at appropriate moments.\n   - Consider grouping multiple contextual updates into a single update (instead of sending every small change separately).\n   - Balance between keeping the session alive and avoiding excessive messaging.\n\n<Info>\n  For detailed implementation examples, check our [SDK\n  documentation](/docs/conversational-ai/libraries/python).\n</Info>\n",

Unlike [server-side tools](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/tools), client tools allow the assistant to perform actions such as triggering browser events, running client-side functions, or sending notifications to a UI.\n\n## Overview\n\nApplications may require assistants to interact directly with the user's environment.

This technique helps maintain natural speech prosody while your LLM generates the complete response.\n\n### Buffer words\n\nWhen your LLM needs more time to process the full response, return an initial response ending with `\"... \"` (ellipsis followed by a space). This allows the Text to Speech system to maintain natural flow while keeping the conversation feeling dynamic.\nThis creates natural pauses that flow well into subsequent content that the LLM can reason longer about. The extra space is crucial to ensure that the subsequent content is not appended to the \"...\" which can lead to audio distortions.\n\n### Implementation\n\nHere's how to modify your custom LLM server to implement buffer words:\n\n<CodeBlocks>\n```python title=\"server.py\"\n@app.post(\"/v1/chat/completions\")\nasync def create_chat_completion(request: ChatCompletionRequest) -> StreamingResponse:\n    oai_request = request.dict(exclude_none=True)\n    if \"user_id\" in oai_request:\n        oai_request[\"user\"] = oai_request.pop(\"user_id\")\n\n    async def event_stream():\n        try:\n            # Send initial buffer chunk while processing\n            initial_chunk = {\n                \"id\": \"chatcmpl-buffer\",\n                \"object\": \"chat.completion.chunk\",\n                \"created\": 1234567890,\n                \"model\": request.model,\n                \"choices\": [{\n                    \"delta\": {\"content\": \"Let me think about that... \"},\n                    \"index\": 0,\n                    \"finish_reason\": None\n                }]\n            }\n            yield f\"data: {json.dumps(initial_chunk)}\\n\\n\"\n\n            # Process the actual LLM response\n            chat_completion_coroutine = await oai_client.chat.completions.create(**oai_request)\n\n            async for chunk in chat_completion_coroutine:\n                chunk_dict = chunk.model_dump()\n                yield f\"data: {json.dumps(chunk_dict)}\\n\\n\"\n            yield \"data: [DONE]\\n\\n\"\n\n        except Exception as e:\n            logging.error(\"An error occurred: %s\", str(e))\n            yield f\"data: {json.dumps({'error': 'Internal error occurred!'})}\\n\\n\"\n\n    return StreamingResponse(event_stream(), media_type=\"text/event-stream\")\n\n````\n\n```typescript title=\"server.ts\"\napp.post('/v1/chat/completions', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {\n  const request = req.body as ChatCompletionRequest;\n  const oaiRequest = { ...request };\n\n  if (oaiRequest.user_id) {\n    oaiRequest.user = oaiRequest.user_id;\n    delete oaiRequest.user_id;\n  }\n\n  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/event-stream');\n  res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'no-cache');\n  res.setHeader('Connection', 'keep-alive');\n\n  try {\n    // Send initial buffer chunk while processing\n    const initialChunk = {\n      id: \"chatcmpl-buffer\",\n      object: \"chat.completion.chunk\",\n      created: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),\n      model: request.model,\n      choices: [{\n        delta: { content: \"Let me think about that... \" },\n        index: 0,\n        finish_reason: null\n      }]\n    };\n    res.write(`data: ${JSON.stringify(initialChunk)}\\n\\n`);\n\n    // Process the actual LLM response\n    const stream = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n      ...oaiRequest,\n      stream: true\n    });\n\n    for await (const chunk of stream) {\n      res.write(`data: ${JSON.stringify(chunk)}\\n\\n`);\n    }\n\n    res.write('data: [DONE]\\n\\n');\n    res.end();\n\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('An error occurred:', error);\n    res.write(`data: ${JSON.stringify({ error: 'Internal error occurred!' })}\\n\\n`);\n    res.end();\n  }\n});\n````\n\n</CodeBlocks>\n\n## System tools integration\n\nYour custom LLM can trigger [system tools](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/tools/system-tools) to control conversation flow and state. These tools are automatically included in the `tools` parameter of your chat completion requests when configured in your agent.\n\n### How system tools work\n\n1. **LLM Decision**: Your custom LLM decides when to call these tools based on conversation context\n2. **Tool Response**: The LLM responds with function calls in standard OpenAI format\n3. **Backend Processing**: ElevenLabs processes the tool calls and updates conversation state\n\nFor more information on system tools, please see [our guide](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/tools/system-tools)\n\n### Available system tools\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"End call\">\n    **Purpose**: Automatically terminate conversations when appropriate conditions are met.\n\n    **Trigger conditions**: The LLM should call this tool when:\n    - The main task has been completed and user is satisfied\n    - The conversation reached natural conclusion with mutual agreement\n    - The user explicitly indicates they want to end the conversation\n\n    **Parameters**:\n    - `reason` (string, required): The reason for ending the call\n    - `message` (string, optional): A farewell message to send to the user before ending the call\n\n    **Function call format**:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"type\": \"function\",\n      \"function\": {\n        \"name\": \"end_call\",\n        \"arguments\": \"{\\\"reason\\\": \\\"Task completed successfully\\\", \\\"message\\\": \\\"Thank you for using our service.

When a Twilio call is received, the ElevenLabs Conversational AI platform will make a webhook call to your specified endpoint, passing call information (`caller_id`, `agent_id`, `called_number`, `call_sid`) as arguments\n2. Your webhook returns conversation initiation client data, including dynamic variables and overrides (an example is shown below)\n3. This data is used to initiate the conversation\n\n<Tip>\n\nThe system uses Twilio's connection/dialing period to fetch webhook data in parallel, creating a\nseamless experience where:\n\n- Users hear the expected telephone connection sound\n- In parallel, theConversational AI platform fetches necessary webhook data\n- The conversation is initiated with the fetched data by the time the audio connection is established\n\n</Tip>\n\n## Configuration\n\n<Steps>\n\n  <Step title=\"Configure webhook details\">\n    In the [settings page](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/settings) of the Conversational AI platform, configure the webhook URL and add any\n    secrets needed for authentication.\n\n    <Frame background=\"subtle\">\n        ![Enable webhook](/assets/images/conversational-ai/convai-settings.png)\n    </Frame>\n\n    Click on the webhook to modify which secrets are sent in the headers.\n\n    <Frame background=\"subtle\">\n        ![Add secrets to headers](/assets/images/conversational-ai/convai-initiation-webhook.png)\n    </Frame>\n\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Enable fetching conversation initiation data\">\n    In the \"Security\" tab of the [agent's page](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/agents/), enable fetching conversation initiation data for inbound Twilio calls, and define fields that can be overridden.\n\n    <Frame background=\"subtle\">\n        ![Enable webhook](/assets/images/conversational-ai/enable-twilio-webhook.png)\n    </Frame>\n\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Implement the webhook endpoint to receive Twilio data\">\n    The webhook will receive a POST request with the following parameters:\n\n    | Parameter       | Type   | Description                            |\n    | --------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- |\n    | `caller_id`     | string | The phone number of the caller         |\n    | `agent_id`      | string | The ID of the agent receiving the call |\n    | `called_number` | string | The Twilio number that was called      |\n    | `call_sid`      | string | Unique identifier for the Twilio call  |\n\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Return conversation initiation client data\">\n   Your webhook must return a JSON response containing the initiation data for the agent.\n  <Info>\n    The `dynamic_variables` field must contain all dynamic variables defined for the agent.

These features allow you to define custom metrics to evaluate agent performance and automatically extract structured data from conversation transcripts.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Conversational AI platform provides two powerful analysis capabilities:\n\n- **Evaluation Criteria**: Define custom metrics to assess conversation quality, goal achievement, and customer satisfaction\n- **Data Collection**: Extract specific data points from conversations such as contact information, issue details, or any structured information\n\nBoth features use LLM-powered analysis to process conversation transcripts and provide actionable insights that help improve agent performance and business outcomes.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluation criteria allow you to define custom goals and success metrics for your conversations. Each criterion is evaluated against the conversation transcript and returns a result of `success`, `failure`, or `unknown`, along with a detailed rationale.\n\n### Types of Evaluation Criteria\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Goal Prompt Criteria\">\n    **Goal prompt criteria** pass the conversation transcript along with a custom prompt to an LLM to verify if a specific goal was met. This is the most flexible type of evaluation and can be used for complex business logic.\n\n    **Examples:**\n    - Customer satisfaction assessment\n    - Issue resolution verification\n    - Compliance checking\n    - Custom business rule validation\n\n    The LLM analyzes the transcript and returns:\n    - **Result**: `success`, `failure`, or `unknown`\n    - **Rationale**: Detailed explanation of why the result was chosen\n\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n### Configuration\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Access agent settings\">\n    Navigate to your agent's dashboard and select the **Analysis** tab to configure evaluation criteria.\n\n    <Frame background=\"subtle\">\n      ![Analysis settings](/assets/images/conversational-ai/analysis-settings.png)\n    </Frame>\n\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Add evaluation criteria\">\n    Click **Add criteria** to create a new evaluation criterion.\n\n    Define your criterion with:\n    - **Identifier**: A unique name for the criterion (e.g., `user_was_not_upset`)\n    - **Description**: Detailed prompt describing what should be evaluated\n\n    <Frame background=\"subtle\">\n      ![Setting up evaluation criteria](/assets/images/conversational-ai/evaluation.gif)\n    </Frame>\n\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"View results\">\n    After conversations complete, evaluation results appear in your conversation history dashboard.

several factors:\n\n- **Task Complexity**: More demanding or nuanced tasks generally benefit from more powerful models (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-4 series, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, Google's Gemini 2.5 models).\n- **Latency Requirements**: For applications requiring real-time or near real-time responses, such as live voice conversations, models optimized for speed are preferable (e.g., Google's Gemini Flash series, Anthropic's Claude Haiku, OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini).\n- **Context Window Size**: If your application needs to process, understand, or recall information from long conversations or extensive documents, select models with larger context windows.\n- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Balance the desired performance and features against your budget. LLM prices can vary significantly, so analyze the pricing structure (input, output, and cache tokens) in relation to your expected usage patterns.\n- **HIPAA Compliance**: If your application involves Protected Health Information (PHI), it is crucial to use an LLM that is designated as HIPAA compliant and ensure your entire data handling process meets regulatory standards.\n\n## HIPAA Compliance\n\nCertain LLMs available on our platform may be suitable for use in environments requiring HIPAA compliance, please see the [HIPAA compliance docs](/docs/conversational-ai/legal/hipaa) for more details\n\n## Understanding LLM Pricing\n\n- **Tokens**: LLM usage is typically billed based on the number of tokens processed. As a general guideline for English text, 100 tokens is approximately equivalent to 75 words.\n- **Input vs. Output Pricing**: Providers often differentiate pricing for input tokens (the data you send to the model) and output tokens (the data the model generates in response).\n- **Cache Pricing**:\n  - `input_cache_read`: This refers to the cost associated with retrieving previously processed input data from a cache. Utilizing cached data can lead to cost savings if identical inputs are processed multiple times.\n  - `input_cache_write`: This is the cost associated with storing input data into a cache. Some LLM providers may charge for this operation.\n- The prices listed in this document are per 1 million tokens and are based on the information available at the time of writing. These prices are subject to change by the LLM providers.\n\nFor the most accurate and current information on model capabilities, pricing, and terms of service, always consult the official documentation from the respective LLM providers (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, xAI).\n",

This guide outlines key strategies to optimize expenditure on the ElevenLabs platform by effectively utilizing its features. For detailed model capabilities and pricing, refer to our main [LLM documentation](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/llm).\n\n<Note>\n  ElevenLabs supports reducing costs by reducing inference of the models during periods of silence.\n  These periods are billed at 5% of the usual per minute rate. See [the Conversational AI overview\n  page](/docs/conversational-ai/overview#pricing-during-silent-periods) for more details.\n</Note>\n\n## Understanding inference costs\n\nLLM inference costs on our platform are primarily influenced by:\n\n- **Input tokens**: The amount of data processed from your prompt, including user queries, system instructions, and any contextual data.\n- **Output tokens**: The number of tokens generated by the LLM in its response.\n- **Model choice**: Different LLMs have varying per-token pricing. More powerful models generally incur higher costs.\n\nMonitoring your usage via the ElevenLabs dashboard or API is crucial for identifying areas for cost reduction.\n\n## Strategic model selection\n\nChoosing the most appropriate LLM is a primary factor in cost efficiency.\n\n- **Right-sizing**: Select the least complex (and typically less expensive) model that can reliably perform your specific task. Avoid using high-cost models for simple operations. For instance, models like Google's `gemini-2.0-flash` offer highly competitive pricing for many common tasks. Always cross-reference with the full [Supported LLMs list](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/llm#supported-llms) for the latest pricing and capabilities.\n- **Experimentation**: Test various models for your tasks, comparing output quality against incurred costs. Consider language support, context window needs, and specialized skills.\n\n## Prompt optimization\n\nPrompt engineering is a powerful technique for reducing token consumption and associated costs. By crafting clear, concise, and unambiguous system prompts, you can guide the model to produce more efficient responses. Eliminate redundant wording and unnecessary context that might inflate your token count. Consider explicitly instructing the model on your desired output length—for example, by adding phrases like \"Limit your response to two sentences\" or \"Provide a brief summary.\" These simple directives can significantly reduce the number of output tokens while maintaining the quality and relevance of the generated content.\n\n**Modular design**: For complex conversational flows, leverage [agent-agent transfer](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/tools/system-tools/agent-transfer). This allows you to break down a single, large system prompt into multiple, smaller, and more specialized prompts, each handled by a different agent. This significantly reduces the token count per interaction by loading only the contextually relevant prompt for the current stage of the conversation, rather than a comprehensive prompt designed for all possibilities.\n\n## Leveraging knowledge and retrieval\n\nFor applications requiring access to large information volumes, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and a well-maintained knowledge base are key.\n\n- **Efficient RAG**:\n  - RAG reduces input tokens by providing the LLM with only relevant snippets from your [Knowledge Base](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/knowledge-base), instead of including extensive data in the prompt.\n  - Optimize the retriever to fetch only the most pertinent \"chunks\" of information.\n  - Fine-tune chunk size and overlap for a balance between context and token count.\n  - Learn more about implementing [RAG](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/knowledge-base/rag).\n- **Context size**:\n  - Ensure your [Knowledge Base](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/knowledge-base) contains accurate, up-to-date, and relevant information.\n  - Well-structured content improves retrieval precision and reduces token usage from irrelevant context.\n\n## Intelligent tool utilization\n\nUsing [Server Tools](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/tools/server-tools) allows LLMs to delegate tasks to external APIs or custom code, which can be more cost-effective.\n\n- **Task offloading**: Identify deterministic tasks, those requiring real-time data, complex calculations, or API interactions (e.g., database lookups, external service calls).\n- **Orchestration**: The LLM acts as an orchestrator, making structured tool calls. This is often far more token-efficient than attempting complex tasks via prompting alone.\n- **Tool descriptions**: Provide clear, concise descriptions for each tool, enabling the LLM to use them efficiently and accurately.\n\n## Checklist\n\nConsider applying these techniques to reduce cost:\n\n| Feature           | Cost impact                                              | Action items                                                                                                                                                        |\n| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| LLM choice        | Reduces per-token cost                                   | Select the smallest, most economical model that reliably performs the task.

ElevenLabs provides the platform for\n  integration but does not manage, endorse, or secure external MCP servers.\n</Error>\n\n## Overview\n\nIntegrating external servers via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) can greatly enhance your ElevenLabs conversational agents. However, this also means connecting to systems outside of ElevenLabs' direct control, which introduces important security considerations. As a user, you are responsible for the security and trustworthiness of any third-party MCP server you choose to integrate.\n\nThis guide outlines key security practices to consider when using MCP server integrations within ElevenLabs.\n\n## Tool approval controls\n\nElevenLabs provides built-in security controls through tool approval modes that help you manage the security risks associated with MCP tool usage. These controls allow you to balance functionality with security based on your specific needs.\n\n<Frame background=\"subtle\">\n  ![Tool approval mode settings](/assets/images/conversational-ai/mcp-approval.png)\n</Frame>\n\n### Approval mode options\n\n- **Always Ask (Recommended)**: Provides maximum security by requiring explicit approval for every tool execution. This mode ensures you maintain full control over all MCP tool usage.\n- **Fine-Grained Tool Approval**: Allows you to configure approval requirements on a per-tool basis, enabling automatic execution of trusted tools while requiring approval for sensitive operations.\n- **No Approval**: Permits unrestricted tool usage without approval prompts. Only use this mode with thoroughly vetted and highly trusted MCP servers.\n\n### Fine-grained security controls\n\nFine-Grained Tool Approval mode provides the most flexible security configuration, allowing you to classify each tool based on its risk profile:\n\n<Frame background=\"subtle\">\n  ![Fine-grained tool approval\n  settings](/assets/images/conversational-ai/mcp-finegrained-approvals.png)\n</Frame>\n\n- **Auto-approved tools**: Suitable for low-risk, read-only operations or tools you completely trust\n- **Approval-required tools**: For tools that modify data, access sensitive information, or perform potentially risky operations\n- **Disabled tools**: Completely block tools that are unnecessary or pose security risks\n\n<Warning>\n  Even with approval controls in place, carefully evaluate the trustworthiness of MCP servers and\n  understand what each tool can access or modify before integration.\n</Warning>\n\n## Security tips\n\n### 1. Vet your MCP servers\n\n- **Trusted Sources**: Only integrate MCP servers from sources you trust and have verified. Understand who operates the server and their security posture.\n- **Understand Capabilities**: Before integrating, thoroughly review the tools and data resources the MCP server exposes. Be aware of what actions its tools can perform (e.g., accessing files, calling external APIs, modifying data). The MCP `destructiveHint` and `readOnlyHint` annotations can provide clues but should not be solely relied upon for security decisions.\n- **Review Server Security**: If possible, review the security practices of the MCP server provider. For MCP servers you develop, ensure you follow general server security best practices and the MCP-specific security guidelines.\n\n### 2. Data sharing and privacy\n\n- **Data Flow**: Be aware that when your agent uses an integrated MCP server, data from the conversation (which may include user inputs) will be sent to that external server.\n- **Sensitive Information**: Exercise caution when allowing agents to send Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or other sensitive data to an MCP server. Ensure the server handles such data securely and in compliance with relevant privacy regulations.\n- **Purpose Limitation**: Configure your agents and prompts to only share the necessary information with MCP server tools to perform their tasks.\n\n### 3. Credential and connection security\n\n- **Secure Storage**: If an MCP server requires API keys or other secrets for authentication, use any available secret management features within the ElevenLabs platform to store these credentials securely. Avoid hardcoding secrets.\n- **HTTPS**: Ensure connections to MCP servers are made over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.\n- **Network Access**: If the MCP server is on a private network, ensure appropriate firewall rules and network ACLs are in place.\n\n### 4. Understand code execution risks\n\n- **Remote Execution**: Tools exposed by an MCP server execute code on that server. While this is the basis of their functionality, it's a critical security consideration. Malicious or poorly secured tools could pose a risk.\n- **Input Validation**: Although the MCP server is responsible for validating inputs to its tools, be mindful of the data your agent might send. The LLM should be guided to use tools as intended.\n\n### 5. Add guardrails\n\n- **Prompt Injections**: Connecting to untrusted external MCP servers exposes the risk of prompt injection attacks. Ensure to add thorough guardrails to your system prompt to reduce the risk of exposure to a malicious attack.\n- **Tool Approval Configuration**: Use the appropriate approval mode for your security requirements. Start with \"Always Ask\" for new integrations and only move to less restrictive modes after thorough testing and trust establishment.\n\n### 6. Monitor and review\n\n- **Logging (Server-Side)**: If you control the MCP server, implement comprehensive logging of tool invocations and data access.\n- **Regular Review**: Periodically review your integrated MCP servers. Check if their security posture has changed or if new tools have been added that require re-assessment.\n- **Approval Patterns**: Monitor tool approval requests to identify unusual patterns that might indicate security issues or misuse.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\n<Warning title=\"Important Disclaimer\">\n  By enabling MCP server integrations, you acknowledge that this may involve data sharing with\n  third-party services not controlled by ElevenLabs. This could incur additional security risks.\n  Please ensure you fully understand the implications, vet the security of any MCP server you\n  integrate, and adhere to these security guidelines before proceeding.\n</Warning>\n\nFor general information on the Model Context Protocol, refer to official MCP documentation and community resources.\n",

Dynamic Variables\n  offer better maintainability and a more structured approach to personalization.\n</Warning>\n\n**Overrides** enable your assistant to adapt its behavior for each user interaction. You can pass custom data and settings at the start of each conversation, allowing the assistant to personalize its responses and knowledge with real-time context. Overrides completely override the agent's default values defined in the agent's [dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/agents).\n\n## Overview\n\nOverrides allow you to modify your AI agent's behavior in real-time without creating multiple agents. This enables you to personalize responses with user-specific data.\n\nOverrides can be enabled for the following fields in the agent's security settings:\n\n- System prompt\n- First message\n- Language\n- Voice ID\n\nWhen overrides are enabled for a field, providing an override is still optional. If not provided, the agent will use the default values defined in the agent's [dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/agents). An error will be thrown if an override is provided for a field that does not have overrides enabled.\n\nHere are a few examples where overrides can be useful:\n\n- **Greet users** by their name\n- **Include account-specific details** in responses\n- **Adjust the agent's language** or tone based on user preferences\n- **Pass real-time data** like account balances or order status\n\n<Info>\n  Overrides are particularly useful for applications requiring personalized interactions or handling\n  sensitive user data that shouldn't be stored in the agent's base configuration.\n</Info>\n\n## Guide\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- An [ElevenLabs account](https://elevenlabs.io)\n- A configured ElevenLabs Conversational Agent ([create one here](/docs/conversational-ai/quickstart))\n\nThis guide will show you how to override the default agent **System prompt** & **First message**.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Enable overrides\">\n    For security reasons, overrides are disabled by default.

Instead of loading entire documents into the context window, RAG retrieves only the most relevant information for each user query, allowing your agent to:\n\n- Access much larger knowledge bases than would fit in a prompt\n- Provide more accurate, knowledge-grounded responses\n- Reduce hallucinations by referencing source material\n- Scale knowledge without creating multiple specialized agents\n\nRAG is ideal for agents that need to reference large documents, technical manuals, or extensive\nknowledge bases that would exceed the context window limits of traditional prompting.\nRAG adds on slight latency to the response time of your agent, around 500ms.\n\n<iframe\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"400\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aFeJO7W0DIk\"\n  title=\"YouTube video player\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n  allowfullscreen\n></iframe>\n\n## How RAG works\n\nWhen RAG is enabled, your agent processes user queries through these steps:\n\n1. **Query processing**: The user's question is analyzed and reformulated for optimal retrieval.\n2. **Embedding generation**: The processed query is converted into a vector embedding that represents the user's question.\n3. **Retrieval**: The system finds the most semantically similar content from your knowledge base.\n4. **Response generation**: The agent generates a response using both the conversation context and the retrieved information.\n\nThis process ensures that relevant information to the user's query is passed to the LLM to generate a factually correct answer.\n\n<Note>\n  When RAG is enabled, the size of knowledge base items that can be assigned to an agent is\n  increased from 300KB to 10MB\n</Note>\n\n## Guide\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- An [ElevenLabs account](https://elevenlabs.io)\n- A configured ElevenLabs [Conversational Agent](/docs/conversational-ai/quickstart)\n- At least one document added to your agent's knowledge base\n\n<Steps>\n    <Step title=\"Enable RAG for your agent\">\n        In your agent's settings, navigate to the **Knowledge Base** section and toggle on the **Use RAG** option.\n\n        <Frame background=\"subtle\">\n        <img src=\"/assets/images/conversational-ai/rag-enabled.png\" alt=\"Toggle switch to enable RAG in the agent settings\" />\n        </Frame>\n    </Step>\n\n    <Step title=\"Configure RAG settings (optional)\">\n    After enabling RAG, you'll see additional configuration options:\n    - **Embedding model**: Select the model that will convert text into vector embeddings\n    - **Maximum document chunks**: Set the maximum amount of retrieved content per query\n    - **Maximum vector distance**: Set the maximum distance between the query and the retrieved chunks\n\n    These parameters could impact latency. They also could impact LLM cost which in the future will be passed on to you.\n    For example, retrieving more chunks increases cost.\n    Increasing vector distance allows for more context to be passed, but potentially less relevant context.\n    This may affect quality and you should experiment with different parameters to find the best results.\n\n    <Frame background=\"subtle\">\n        <img\n        src=\"/assets/images/conversational-ai/rag-config.png\"\n        alt=\"RAG configuration options including embedding model selection\"\n        />\n    </Frame>\n    </Step>\n\n    <Step title=\"Knowledge base indexing\">\n    Each document in your knowledge base needs to be indexed before it can be used with RAG.

These tools are referenced by **name**, not by ID.\n\n### Critical deadlines\n\n<Check>\n  **July 14, 2025** - Last day for full backwards compatibility. You can continue using\n  `prompt.tools` until this date.\n</Check>\n\n<Note>\n  **July 15, 2025** - GET endpoints will stop returning the `tools` field.

All requests\n  containing this field will be rejected.\n</Warning>\n\n## Why the change?\n\nDecoupling tools from agents brings several advantages:\n\n- **Re-use** – the same tool can be shared across multiple agents.\n- **Simpler audits** – inspect, update or delete a tool in one place.\n- **Cleaner payloads** – agent configurations stay lightweight.\n\n## What has already happened?\n\n<Check>\n  Good news — we've already migrated your data! Every tool that previously lived in `prompt.tools`\n  now exists as a standalone record, and its ID is present in the agent's `prompt.tool_ids` array.\n  No scripts required.\n</Check>\n\nWe have **automatically migrated all existing data**:\n\n- Every tool that was previously in an agent's `prompt.tools` array now exists as a standalone record.\n- The agent's `prompt.tool_ids` array already references those new tool records.\n\nNo one-off scripts are required — your agents continue to work unchanged.\n\n## Deprecation timeline\n\n| Date              | Status                   | Behaviour                                                                        |\n| ----------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **July 14, 2025** | ✅ Full compatibility    | You may keep sending `prompt.tools`.

This is a system tool that provides flexibility in how and when calls are ended.\n\n## Functionality\n\n- **Default behavior**: The tool can operate without any user-defined prompts, ending the call when the conversation naturally concludes.\n- **Custom prompts**: Users can specify conditions under which the call should end. For example:\n  - End the call if the user says \"goodbye.\"\n  - Conclude the call when a specific task is completed.\n\n<Markdown src=\"/snippets/end_call_custom_llm.mdx\" />\n\n### API Implementation\n\nWhen creating an agent via API, you can add the End Call tool to your agent configuration. It should be defined as a system tool:\n\n<CodeBlocks>\n\n```python\nfrom elevenlabs import (\n    ConversationalConfig,\n    ElevenLabs,\n    AgentConfig,\n    PromptAgent,\n    PromptAgentInputToolsItem_System\n)\n\n# Initialize the client\nelevenlabs = ElevenLabs(api_key=\"YOUR_API_KEY\")\n\n# Create the end call tool\nend_call_tool = PromptAgentInputToolsItem_System(\n    name=\"end_call\",\n    description=\"\"  # Optional: Customize when the tool should be triggered\n)\n\n# Create the agent configuration\nconversation_config = ConversationalConfig(\n    agent=AgentConfig(\n        prompt=PromptAgent(\n            tools=[end_call_tool]\n        )\n    )\n)\n\n# Create the agent\nresponse = elevenlabs.conversational_ai.agents.create(\n    conversation_config=conversation_config\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nimport { ElevenLabs } from '@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js';\n\n// Initialize the client\nconst elevenlabs = new ElevenLabs({\n  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',\n});\n\n// Create the agent with end call tool\nawait elevenlabs.conversationalAi.agents.create({\n  conversationConfig: {\n    agent: {\n      prompt: {\n        tools: [\n          {\n            type: 'system',\n            name: 'end_call',\n            description: '', // Optional: Customize when the tool should be triggered\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/agents/create \\\n     -H \"xi-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\n  \"conversation_config\": {\n    \"agent\": {\n      \"prompt\": {\n        \"tools\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"system\",\n            \"name\": \"end_call\",\n            \"description\": \"\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}'\n```\n\n</CodeBlocks>\n\n<Tip>Leave the description blank to use the default end call prompt.</Tip>\n\n## Example prompts\n\n**Example 1: Basic End Call**\n\n```\nEnd the call when the user says goodbye, thank you, or indicates they have no more questions.\n```\n\n**Example 2: End Call with Custom Prompt**\n\n```\nEnd the call when the user says goodbye, thank you, or indicates they have no more questions.

This enables agents to hand off complex issues, specific requests, or situations requiring human intervention to a live operator.\n\nThis feature utilizes the `transfer_to_number` system tool which supports transfers via Twilio and SIP trunk numbers. When triggered, the agent can provide a message to the user while they wait and a separate message summarizing the situation for the human operator receiving the call.\n\n<Markdown src=\"/snippets/human_transfer_custom_llm.mdx\" />\n\n## Numbers that can be transferred to\n\nCurrently only [SIP trunking](/docs/conversational-ai/phone-numbers/sip-trunking) phone numbers support transferring to external numbers.\n[Twilio phone numbers](/docs/conversational-ai/phone-numbers/twilio-integration/native-integration) currently can only transfer to phone numbers hosted on Twilio. If this is needed we recommended using Twilio numbers via [Twilio elastic SIP trunking](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sip-trunking) and our SIP trunking support, rather than via the native integration.\n\n## Enabling human transfer\n\nHuman transfer is configured using the `transfer_to_number` system tool.\n\n<Steps>\n    <Step title=\"Add the transfer tool\">\n        Enable human transfer by selecting the `transfer_to_number` system tool in your agent's configuration within the `Agent` tab. Choose \"Transfer to Human\" when adding a tool.\n\n        <Frame background=\"subtle\" caption=\"Select 'Transfer to Human' tool\">\n            {/* Placeholder for image showing adding the 'Transfer to Human' tool */}\n            <img src=\"/assets/images/conversational-ai/transfer_human.png\" alt=\"Add Human Transfer Tool\" />\n        </Frame>\n    </Step>\n\n    <Step title=\"Configure tool description (optional)\">\n        You can provide a custom description to guide the LLM on when to trigger a transfer. If left blank, a default description encompassing the defined transfer rules will be used.\n\n        <Frame background=\"subtle\" caption=\"Configure transfer tool description\">\n             {/* Placeholder for image showing the tool description field */}\n             <img src=\"/assets/images/conversational-ai/transfer_human_tool.png\" alt=\"Human Transfer Tool Description\" />\n        </Frame>\n    </Step>\n\n    <Step title=\"Define transfer rules\">\n        Configure the specific rules for transferring to phone numbers. For each rule, specify:\n        - **Phone Number**: The target phone number in E.164 format (e.g., +12125551234) to transfer the call to.\n        - **Condition**: A natural language description of the circumstances under which the transfer should occur (e.g., \"User explicitly requests to speak to a human\", \"User needs to update sensitive account information\").\n\n        The LLM will use these conditions, along with the tool description, to decide when and to which phone number to transfer.\n\n        <Frame background=\"subtle\" caption=\"Define transfer rules with phone number and condition\">\n            {/* Placeholder for image showing transfer rules configuration */}\n            <img src=\"/assets/images/conversational-ai/transfer_human_rule.png\" alt=\"Human Transfer Rules Configuration\" />\n        </Frame>\n\n        <Note>\n            Ensure the phone number is correctly formatted (E.164) and associated with a properly configured Twilio account capable of receiving calls.\n        </Note>\n    </Step>\n\n</Steps>\n\n## API Implementation\n\nYou can configure the `transfer_to_number` system tool when creating or updating an agent via the API. The tool allows specifying messages for both the client (user being transferred) and the agent (human operator receiving the call).\n\n<CodeBlocks>\n\n```python\nfrom elevenlabs import (\n    ConversationalConfig,\n    ElevenLabs,\n    AgentConfig,\n    PromptAgent,\n    PromptAgentInputToolsItem_System,\n    SystemToolConfigInputParams_TransferToNumber,\n    PhoneNumberTransfer,\n)\n\n# Initialize the client\nelevenlabs = ElevenLabs(api_key=\"YOUR_API_KEY\")\n\n# Define transfer rules\ntransfer_rules = [\n    PhoneNumberTransfer(phone_number=\"+15551234567\", condition=\"When the user asks for billing support.\"),\n    PhoneNumberTransfer(phone_number=\"+15559876543\", condition=\"When the user requests to file a formal complaint.\")\n]\n\n# Create the transfer tool configuration\ntransfer_tool = PromptAgentInputToolsItem_System(\n    type=\"system\",\n    name=\"transfer_to_human\",\n    description=\"Transfer the user to a specialized agent based on their request.\", # Optional custom description\n    params=SystemToolConfigInputParams_TransferToNumber(\n        transfers=transfer_rules\n    )\n)\n\n# Create the agent configuration\nconversation_config = ConversationalConfig(\n    agent=AgentConfig(\n        prompt=PromptAgent(\n            prompt=\"You are a helpful assistant.\",\n            first_message=\"Hi, how can I help you today?\",\n            tools=[transfer_tool],\n        )\n    )\n)\n\n# Create the agent\nresponse = elevenlabs.conversational_ai.agents.create(\n    conversation_config=conversation_config\n)\n\n# Note: When the LLM decides to call this tool, it needs to provide:\n# - transfer_number: The phone number to transfer to (must match one defined in rules).\n# - client_message: Message read to the user during transfer.\n# - agent_message: Message read to the human operator receiving the call.\n```\n\n```javascript\nimport { ElevenLabs } from '@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js';\n\n// Initialize the client\nconst elevenlabs = new ElevenLabs({\n  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',\n});\n\n// Define transfer rules\nconst transferRules = [\n  { phoneNumber: '+15551234567', condition: 'When the user asks for billing support.' },\n  { phoneNumber: '+15559876543', condition: 'When the user requests to file a formal complaint.' },\n];\n\n// Create the agent with the transfer tool\nawait elevenlabs.conversationalAi.agents.create({\n  conversationConfig: {\n    agent: {\n      prompt: {\n        prompt: 'You are a helpful assistant.',\n        firstMessage: 'Hi, how can I help you today?',\n        tools: [\n          {\n            type: 'system',\n            name: 'transfer_to_number',\n            description: 'Transfer the user to a human operator based on their request.', // Optional custom description\n            params: {\n              systemToolType: 'transfer_to_number',\n              transfers: transferRules,\n            },\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    },\n  },\n});\n\n// Note: When the LLM decides to call this tool, it needs to provide:\n// - transfer_number: The phone number to transfer to (must match one defined in rules).\n// - client_message: Message read to the user during transfer.\n// - agent_message: Message read to the human operator receiving the call.\n</code_block_to_apply_changes_from>\n```\n\n</CodeBlocks>\n",

You can define a set of tools that the assistant has access to, and the assistant will use them where appropriate based on the conversation.\n\n## Overview\n\nMany applications require assistants to call external APIs to get real-time information. Tools give your assistant the ability to make external function calls to third party apps so you can get real-time information.\n\nHere are a few examples where tools can be useful:\n\n- **Fetching data**: enable an assistant to retrieve real-time data from any REST-enabled database or 3rd party integration before responding to the user.\n- **Taking action**: allow an assistant to trigger authenticated actions based on the conversation, like scheduling meetings or initiating order returns.\n\n<Info>\n  To interact with Application UIs or trigger client-side events use [client\n  tools](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/tools/client-tools) instead.\n</Info>\n\n## Tool configuration\n\nConversational AI assistants can be equipped with tools to interact with external APIs. Unlike traditional requests, the assistant generates query, body, and path parameters dynamically based on the conversation and parameter descriptions you provide.\n\nAll tool configurations and parameter descriptions help the assistant determine **when** and **how** to use these tools. To orchestrate tool usage effectively, update the assistant’s system prompt to specify the sequence and logic for making these calls. This includes:\n\n- **Which tool** to use and under what conditions.\n- **What parameters** the tool needs to function properly.\n- **How to handle** the responses.\n\n<br />\n\n<Tabs>\n\n<Tab title=\"Configuration\">\nDefine a high-level `Name` and `Description` to describe the tool's purpose. This helps the LLM understand the tool and know when to call it.\n\n<Info>\n  If the API requires path parameters, include variables in the URL path by wrapping them in curly\n  braces `{}`, for example: `/api/resource/{id}` where `id` is a path parameter.\n</Info>\n\n<Frame background=\"subtle\">\n  ![Configuration](/assets/images/conversational-ai/tool-configuration.jpg)\n</Frame>\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab title=\"Secrets\">\n\nAssistant secrets can be used to add authentication headers to requests.\n\n<Frame background=\"subtle\">\n  ![Tool secrets](/assets/images/conversational-ai/tool-secrets.jpg)\n</Frame>\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab title=\"Headers\">\n\nSpecify any headers that need to be included in the request.\n\n<Frame background=\"subtle\">![Headers](/assets/images/conversational-ai/tool-headers.jpg)</Frame>\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab title=\"Path parameters\">\n\nInclude variables in the URL path by wrapping them in curly braces `{}`:\n\n- **Example**: `/api/resource/{id}` where `id` is a path parameter.\n\n<Frame background=\"subtle\">\n  ![Path parameters](/assets/images/conversational-ai/tool-path-parameters.jpg)\n</Frame>\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab title=\"Body parameters\">\n\nSpecify any body parameters to be included in the request.\n\n<Frame background=\"subtle\">\n  ![Body parameters](/assets/images/conversational-ai/tool-body-parameters.jpg)\n</Frame>\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab title=\"Query parameters\">\n\nSpecify any query parameters to be included in the request.\n\n<Frame background=\"subtle\">\n  ![Query parameters](/assets/images/conversational-ai/tool-query-parameters.jpg)\n</Frame>\n\n</Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\n## Guide\n\nIn this guide, we'll create a weather assistant that can provide real-time weather information for any location.

This system tool is useful when the user indicates they need a moment, for example, by saying \"Give me a second,\" \"Let me think,\" or \"One moment please.\"\n\n## Functionality\n\n- **User-Initiated Pause**: The tool is designed to be invoked by the LLM when it detects that the user needs a brief pause without interruption.\n- **No Verbal Response**: After this tool is called, the assistant will not speak. It waits for the user to re-engage or for another turn-taking condition to be met.\n- **Seamless Conversation Flow**: It helps maintain a natural conversational rhythm by respecting the user's need for a short break without ending the interaction or the agent speaking unnecessarily.\n\n<Markdown src=\"/snippets/skip_turn_custom_llm.mdx\" />\n\n### API implementation\n\nWhen creating an agent via API, you can add the Skip Turn tool to your agent configuration.

This is particularly useful for:\n\n- Correcting pronunciation of names, places, or technical terms\n- Ensuring consistent pronunciation across conversations\n- Customizing regional pronunciation variations\n\n<Frame background=\"subtle\">\n  <img\n    src=\"/assets/images/conversational-ai/pd-convai.png\"\n    alt=\"Pronunciation dictionary settings under the Voice tab\"\n  />\n</Frame>\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou can find the pronunciation dictionary settings under the **Voice** tab in your agent's configuration.\n\n<Note>\n  The phoneme function of pronunciation dictionaries only works with the Turbo v2 model, while the\n  alias function works with all models.\n</Note>\n\n## Dictionary file format\n\nPronunciation dictionaries use XML-based `.pls` files. Here's an example structure:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<lexicon version=\"1.0\"\n      xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/01/pronunciation-lexicon\"\n      xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/01/pronunciation-lexicon\n        http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/CR-pronunciation-lexicon-20071212/pls.xsd\"\n      alphabet=\"ipa\" xml:lang=\"en-GB\">\n  <lexeme>\n    <grapheme>Apple</grapheme>\n    <phoneme>ˈæpl̩</phoneme>\n  </lexeme>\n  <lexeme>\n    <grapheme>UN</grapheme>\n    <alias>United Nations</alias>\n  </lexeme>\n</lexicon>\n```\n\n## Supported formats\n\nWe support two types of pronunciation notation:\n\n1. **IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)**\n\n   - More precise control over pronunciation\n   - Requires knowledge of IPA symbols\n   - Example: \"nginx\" as `/ˈɛndʒɪnˈɛks/`\n\n2. **CMU (Carnegie Mellon University) Dictionary format**\n   - Simpler ASCII-based format\n   - More accessible for English pronunciations\n   - Example: \"tomato\" as \"T AH M EY T OW\"\n\n<Tip>\n  You can use AI tools like Claude or ChatGPT to help generate IPA or CMU notations for specific\n  words.\n</Tip>\n\n## Best practices\n\n1. **Case sensitivity**: Create separate entries for capitalized and lowercase versions of words if needed\n2. **Testing**: Always test pronunciations with your chosen voice and model\n3. **Maintenance**: Keep your dictionary organized and documented\n4. **Scope**: Focus on words that are frequently mispronounced or critical to your use case\n\n## FAQ\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"Which models support phoneme-based pronunciation?\">\n    Currently, only the Turbo v2 model supports phoneme-based pronunciation.

This feature is ideal for scenarios such as sending notifications, conducting surveys, or delivering personalized messages to a large list of recipients efficiently.\nThis feature is available for both phone numbers added via the [native Twilio integration](/docs/conversational-ai/phone-numbers/twilio-integration/native-integration) and [SIP trunking](/docs/conversational-ai/phone-numbers/sip-trunking).\n\n### Key features\n\n- **Upload recipient lists**: Easily upload recipient lists in CSV or XLS format.\n- **Dynamic variables**: Personalize calls by including dynamic variables (e.g., `user_name`) in your recipient list as seperate columns.\n- **Agent selection**: Choose the specific Conversational AI agent to handle the calls.\n- **Scheduling**: Send batches immediately or schedule them for a later time.\n- **Real-time monitoring**: Track the progress of your batch calls, including overall status and individual call status.\n- **Detailed reporting**: View comprehensive details of completed batch calls, including individual call recipient information.\n\n## Concurrency\n\nWhen batch calls are initiated, they automatically utilize up to 70% of your plan's concurrency limit.\nThis leaves 30% of your concurrent capacity available for other conversations, including incoming calls and calls via the widget.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- An ElevenLabs account with an [agent setup](/app/conversational-ai).\n- A phone number imported\n\n## Creating a batch call\n\nFollow these steps to create a new batch call:\n\n<Steps>\n\n<Step title=\"Navigate to Batch Calling\">\n  Access the [Outbound calls interface](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/batch-calling)\n  from the Conversational AI dashboard\n</Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Initiate a new batch call\">\n  Click on the \"Create a batch call\" button. This will open the \"Create a batch call\" page.\n\n  <Frame background=\"subtle\" caption=\"The 'Create a batch call' interface.\">\n    <img\n      src=\"/assets/images/conversational-ai/batch-call-creation.png\"\n      alt=\"Create a batch call page showing fields for batch name, phone number, agent selection, recipient upload, and timing options.\"\n    />\n  </Frame>\n</Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Configure batch details\">\n\n- **Batch name**: Enter a descriptive name for your batch call (e.g., \"Delivery notice\", \"Weekly Update Notifications\").\n- **Phone number**: Select the phone number that will be used to make the outbound calls.\n- **Select agent**: Choose the pre-configured Conversational AI agent that will handle the conversations for this batch.\n\n</Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Upload recipients\">\n\n- **Upload File**: Upload your recipient list. Supported file formats are CSV and XLS.\n- **Formatting**:\n  - The `phone_number` column is mandatory in your uploaded file (if your agent has a `phone_number` dynamic variable that also has to be set, please rename it).\n  - You can include other columns (e.g., `name`, `user_name`) which will be passed as dynamic variables to personalize the calls.\n  - A template is available for download to ensure correct formatting.\n\n<Note title=\"Setting overrides\">\n  The following column headers are special fields that are used to override an agent's initial\n  configuration:\n    - language\n    - first_message\n    - system_prompt\n    - voice_id\n\nThe batch call will fail if those fields are passed but are not set to be overridable in the agent's security settings. See more\n[here](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/personalization/overrides).\n\n</Note>\n\n</Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Set timing\">\n  - **Send immediately**: The batch call will start processing as soon as you submit it. -\n  **Schedule for later**: Choose a specific date and time for the batch call to begin.\n</Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Submit the batch call\">\n  - You may \"Test call\" with a single recipient before submitting the entire batch. - Click \"Submit\n  a Batch Call\" to finalize and initiate or schedule the batch.\n</Step>\n\n</Steps>\n\n## Managing and monitoring batch calls\n\nOnce a batch call is created, you can monitor its progress and view its details.\n\n### Batch calling overview\n\nThe Batch Calling overview page displays a list of all your batch calls.\n\n<Frame\n  background=\"subtle\"\n  caption=\"Overview of batch calls, displaying status, progress, and other details for each batch.\"\n>\n  <img\n    src=\"/assets/images/conversational-ai/batch-call-summary.png\"\n    alt=\"Batch Calling overview page listing several batch calls with their status, recipient count, and progress.\"\n  />\n</Frame>\n\n### Viewing batch call details\n\nClicking on a specific batch call from the overview page will take you to its detailed view, from where you can view individual conversations.\n\n<Frame\n  background=\"subtle\"\n  caption=\"Detailed view of a specific batch call, showing summary statistics and a list of call recipients with their individual statuses.\"\n>\n  <img\n    src=\"/assets/images/conversational-ai/batch-call-completed-summary.png\"\n    alt=\"Batch call details page showing a summary (status, total recipients, started, progress) and a list of call recipients with phone number, dynamic variables, and status.\"\n  />\n</Frame>\n\n## API Usage\n\nYou can also manage and initiate batch calls programmatically using the ElevenLabs API.

When enabled, your agents can handle up to 3 times your normal concurrency limit, with excess calls charged at double the standard rate.\n\nThis feature helps prevent missed calls during traffic spikes while maintaining cost predictability for your regular usage patterns.\n\n## How burst pricing works\n\nWhen burst pricing is enabled for an agent:\n\n1. **Normal capacity**: Calls within your subscription limit are charged at standard rates\n2. **Burst capacity**: Additional calls (up to 3x your limit or 300 concurrent calls, whichever is lower) are accepted but charged at 2x the normal rate\n3. **Over-capacity rejection**: Calls exceeding the burst limit are rejected with an error\n\n### Capacity calculations\n\n| Subscription limit | Burst capacity | Maximum concurrent calls |\n| ------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------ |\n| 10 calls           | 30 calls       | 30 calls                 |\n| 50 calls           | 150 calls      | 150 calls                |\n| 100 calls          | 300 calls      | 300 calls                |\n| 200 calls          | 300 calls      | 300 calls (capped)       |\n\n<Note>Burst capacity is capped at 300 concurrent calls regardless of your subscription limit.</Note>\n\n## Cost implications\n\nBurst pricing follows a tiered charging model:\n\n- **Within subscription limit**: Standard per-minute rates apply\n- **Burst calls**: Charged at 2x the standard rate\n- **Deprioritized processing**: Burst calls receive lower priority for speech-to-text and text-to-speech processing\n\n### Example pricing scenario\n\nFor a workspace with a 20-call subscription limit:\n\n- Calls 1-20: Standard rate (e.g., $0.08/minute)\n- Calls 21-60: Double rate (e.g., $0.16/minute)\n- Calls 61+: Rejected\n\n<Warning>\n  Burst calls are deprioritized and may experience higher latency for speech processing, similar to\n  anonymous-tier requests.\n</Warning>\n\n## Configuration\n\nBurst pricing is configured per agent in the call limits settings.\n\n### Dashboard configuration\n\n1. Navigate to your agent settings\n2. Go to the **Call Limits** section\n3. Enable the **Burst pricing** toggle\n4. Save your agent configuration\n\n### API configuration\n\nBurst pricing can be configured via the API, as shown in the examples below\n\n<CodeBlocks>\n\n```python title=\"Python\"\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs\nimport os\n\nload_dotenv()\n\nelevenlabs = ElevenLabs(\n    api_key=os.getenv(\"ELEVENLABS_API_KEY\"),\n)\n\n# Update agent with burst pricing enabled\nresponse = elevenlabs.conversational_ai.agents.update(\n    agent_id=\"your-agent-id\",\n    agent_config={\n        \"platform_settings\": {\n            \"call_limits\": {\n                \"agent_concurrency_limit\": -1,  # Use workspace limit\n                \"daily_limit\": 1000,\n                \"bursting_enabled\": True\n            }\n        }\n    }\n)\n```\n\n```javascript title=\"JavaScript\"\nimport { ElevenLabsClient } from '@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js';\nimport 'dotenv/config';\n\nconst elevenlabs = new ElevenLabsClient();\n\n// Configure agent with burst pricing enabled\nconst updatedConfig = {\n  platformSettings: {\n    callLimits: {\n      agentConcurrencyLimit: -1, // Use workspace limit\n      dailyLimit: 1000,\n      burstingEnabled: true,\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n// Update the agent configuration\nconst response = await elevenlabs.conversationalAi.agents.update('your-agent-id', updatedConfig);\n```\n\n</CodeBlocks>\n",

Be friendly, precise, and concise.\n\n    Begin by briefly asking for the purpose of the meeting and the caller's preferred date and time.\n    Then, ask about the desired meeting duration (15, 30, or 60 minutes), and wait for the user's response before proceeding.\n\n    Once you have the meeting details, say you will check calendar availability:\n    - Call get_available_slots with the appropriate date range\n    - Verify if the requested time slot is available\n    - If not available, suggest alternative times from the available slots\n    - Continue until a suitable time is agreed upon\n\n    After confirming a time slot, gather the following contact details:\n    - The attendee's full name\n    - A valid email address. Note that the email address is transcribed from voice, so ensure it is formatted correctly.\n    - The attendee's time zone (in 'Continent/City' format like 'America/New_York')\n    - Read the email back to the caller to confirm accuracy\n\n    Once all details are confirmed, explain that you will create the meeting.\n    Create the meeting by using the book_meeting tool with the following parameters:\n    - start: The agreed meeting time in ISO 8601 format\n    - eventTypeId: The appropriate ID based on the meeting duration (15min: 1351800, 30min: 1351801, 60min: 1351802)\n    - attendee: An object containing the name, email, and timeZone\n\n    Thank the attendee and inform them they will receive a calendar invitation shortly.\n\n    Clarifications:\n    - Do not inform the user that you are formatting the email; simply do it.\n    - If the caller asks you to proceed with booking, do so with the existing information.\n\n    Guardrails:\n    - Do not share any internal IDs or API details with the caller.\n    - If booking fails, check for formatting issues in the email or time conflicts.\n    ```\n\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n## Setup\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Store your cal.com secret\">\n    To make authenticated requests to external APIs like Cal.com, you need to store your API keys securely. Start by generating a new [Cal.com API key](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v1/introduction#get-your-api-keys).\n\n    Not all APIs have the same authentication structure. For example, the Cal.com API expects the following authentication header:\n\n    ```plaintext Cal request header structure\n    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'\n    ```\n\n    Once you have your API key, store it in the assistant's secret storage. This ensures that your key is kept secure and accessible when making requests.\n    <Warning>\n      To match the expected authentication structure of Cal.com, remember to prepend the API key with `Bearer ` when creating the secret.\n    </Warning>\n    <Frame background=\"subtle\">\n      ![Tool secrets](/assets/images/conversational-ai/tool-secrets.jpg)\n    </Frame>\n\n  </Step>\n<Step title=\"Adding tools to the assistant\">\n  To enable your assistant to manage calendar bookings, we'll create two tools:\n  \n  1. **`get_available_slots`**: When a user asks, _\"Is Louis free at 10:30 AM on Tuesday?\"_, the assistant should use [Cal.com's \"Get available slots\" endpoint](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/slots/find-out-when-is-an-event-type-ready-to-be-booked) to check for available time slots.\n  \n  2. **`book_meeting`**: After identifying a suitable time, the assistant can proceed to book the meeting using [Cal.com's \"Create a booking\" endpoint](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/bookings/create-a-booking#create-a-booking).\n\nFirst, head to the **Tools** section of your dashboard and choose **Add Tool**.

The cascade logic handles these situations gracefully.\n\n## How it Works\n\nThe cascading process follows a defined sequence:\n\n1.  **Preferred LLM Attempt:** The system first attempts to generate a response using the LLM selected in the agent's configuration.\n\n2.  **Backup LLM Sequence:** If the preferred LLM fails, the system automatically falls back to a predefined sequence of backup LLMs. This sequence is curated based on model performance, speed, and reliability. The current default sequence (subject to change) is:\n\n    1.  Gemini 2.5 Flash\n    2.  Gemini 2.0 Flash\n    3.  Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite\n    4.  Claude 3.7 Sonnet\n    5.  Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2\n    6.  Claude 3.5 Sonnet v1\n    7.  GPT-4o\n    8.  Gemini 1.5 Pro\n    9.  Gemini 1.5 Flash\n\n3.  **HIPAA Compliance:** If the agent operates in a mode requiring strict data privacy (HIPAA compliance / zero data retention), the backup list is filtered to include only compliant models from the sequence above.\n\n4.  **Retries:** The system retries the generation process multiple times (at least 3 attempts) across the sequence of available LLMs (preferred + backups). If a backup LLM also fails, it proceeds to the next one in the sequence. If it runs out of unique backup LLMs within the retry limit, it may retry previously failed backup models.\n\n5.  **Lazy Initialization:** Backup LLM connections are initialized only when needed, optimizing resource usage.\n\n<Info>\n  The specific list and order of backup LLMs are managed internally by ElevenLabs and optimized for\n  performance and availability. The sequence listed above represents the current default but may be\n  updated without notice.\n</Info>\n\n## Custom LLMs\n\nWhen you configure a [Custom LLM](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/llm/custom-llm), the standard cascading logic to _other_ models is bypassed. The system will attempt to use your specified Custom LLM.\n\nIf your Custom LLM fails, the system will retry the request with the _same_ Custom LLM multiple times (matching the standard minimum retry count) before considering the request failed. It will not fall back to ElevenLabs-hosted models, ensuring your specific configuration is respected.\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **Increased Reliability:** Reduces the impact of temporary issues with a specific LLM provider.\n- **Higher Availability:** Increases the likelihood of successfully generating a response even during partial LLM outages.\n- **Seamless Operation:** The fallback mechanism is automatic and transparent to the end-user.\n\n## Configuration\n\nLLM cascading is an automatic background process. The only configuration required is selecting your **Preferred LLM** in the agent's settings. The system handles the rest to ensure robust performance.\n",

This can be adapted to meet your particular workflow.\n      </Step>\n\n      <Step title=\"Get previous interactions\">\n        While previous interactions can also be fetched and passed at the beginning of the conversation (see [Personalization](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/personalization)). In this case we are fetching them during the conversation with two tool calls:\n        - The tool `get_previous_calls` will fetch the previous conversations, using the contact ID retrieved during identification.\n        - The response does not include the content of those conversations, so we need to use another endpoint to fetch the content with those call IDs.\n      </Step>\n\n      <Step title=\"Ticket Creation\">\n        - The agent can discuss the issue at hand, relating to previous interactions.\n        - Use the `create_ticket` tool to create a ticket for a follow up item\n        - Associate the ticket created to the CRM contact\n      </Step>\n    </Steps>\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Detailed system prompt\">\n    ```\n    # Personality\n\n    You are a customer support agent. You are helpful, efficient, and polite. Your goal is to quickly understand the caller's issue and create a support ticket.\n\n    # Environment\n\n    You are answering a phone call from a customer. You have access to tools to search for customer contact information, previous calls and create tickets.\n\n    # Tone\n\n    You are professional and courteous. You speak clearly and concisely. You use a friendly tone and show empathy for the customer's situation. You confirm information to ensure accuracy.\n\n    # Goal\n\n    Your primary goal is to efficiently create a support ticket for the customer.\n\n    1.  **Verify Identity:** Ask the caller for their email address to verify their identity. Silently use the `search_contact` tool to verify the caller exists. Use their name after this.\n    2.  **Understand Issue:** Ask the customer what they are calling about and actively listen to capture their intent.\n    3.  **Get previous interactions:**: Silently (without saying you will do it) call get_previous_calls and immediately after call get_call_content with the call ids, to see if previous interactions are relevant to the issue. Ask about their problem, and reference previous conversations if relevant. Use this information with the user.\n    4.  **Create Ticket:** If the user wants to report an issue, make a new purchase, or discuss something else, use the `create_ticket` tool to create a ticket with the details of the customer's issue. Extract the description from the conversation.\n    5.  **Confirmation:** Confirm the ticket details with the customer and communicate the ticket number to the caller, and mention a dedicated advisor will be in touch.\n\n    # Guardrails\n\n    *   Only use the tools provided.\n    *   Do not provide information that is not related to the customer.\n    *   Do not ask for personal information beyond what is needed to verify identity.\n    *   Remain polite and professional at all times, even if the customer is upset.\n    *   If you cannot create a ticket, explain why and offer alternative solutions.\n\n    # Tools\n\n    *   `search_contact`: Use this tool to search for customer contact information using phone number or other identifying details.\n    *   `create_ticket`: Use this tool to create a support ticket with the customer's issue. Capture the customer's description of the issue accurately.\n    *   `get_previous_calls`: Use this tool to fetch previous interactions with the customer.\n    *   `get_call_content`: Use this tool to get the content of the previous interactions with the customer.\n\n    ```\n\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n<Tip>\n  This integration enhances agent efficiency by leveraging CRM interactions. All API calls require\n  proper secret handling in the authorization headers.\n</Tip>\n\n## Authentication Setup\n\nBefore configuring the tools, you must set up authentication with HubSpot.\n\n### Step 1: Generate HubsPot API Token\n\n1. Log into your HubSpot account\n2. Navigate to **Account Management → Integrations → Private Apps**\n3. Create a **Private App**\n4. Add the required scopes to the private app, to ensure it can interact with the required endpoints\n\n```\ncrm.objects.contacts.read\ncrm.objects.contacts.write\ncrm.schemas.contacts.read\ncrm.schemas.contacts.write\ntickets\n```\n\n5. Save and get the Access token from the Auth section\n\n### Step 2: Create Authentication Secret\n\nThe HubSpot API requires Bearer authentication. You need to create a properly formatted secret:\n\n1. **Create the secret value** by adding \"Bearer \" prefix:\n\n   ```\n   Bearer pat-eu1-12345678-abcdefgh-ijklmnop-qrstuvwx\n   ```\n\n2. **Save this as a secret** in your agent's secrets with name `hubspot_key`\n\n## Tool Configurations\n\nThis sample integration with HubSpot employs four webhook tools. Use the tabs below to review each tool's configuration.\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"search_contact\">\n    **Name:** search_contact  \n    **Description:** Search for a contact with an email.  \n    **Method:** POST  \n    **URL:** `https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts/search`\n    \n    **Headers:**\n    - **Content-Type:** `application/json`\n    - **Authorization:** *(Secret: `hubspot_key`)*\n\n    **Body Parameters:**\n    - **filtersGroups:** An array containing:\n      - An object containing:\n        - **filters:** An array containing:\n          - An object containing:\n            - **value:** A string with description: `Set to the email provided by the user. Email should be in format: \"name@address.com\"`\n            - **propertyName:** A string with description: `Set to: \"email\"`\n            - **operator:** A string with description: `Set to: \"CONTAINS_TOKEN\"`\n\n    **Tool JSON:**\n\n    Here is the tool JSON that can be copied into the tool config:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"id\": \"tool_01jxftmwvxfgersp4aw0xhyhea\",\n      \"type\": \"webhook\",\n      \"name\": \"search_contact\",\n      \"description\": \"search for a contact using phone\",\n      \"api_schema\": {\n        \"url\": \"https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts/search\",\n        \"method\": \"POST\",\n        \"path_params_schema\": [],\n        \"query_params_schema\": [],\n        \"request_body_schema\": {\n          \"id\": \"body\",\n          \"type\": \"object\",\n          \"description\": \"filters for searching contacts\",\n          \"required\": false,\n          \"properties\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"filterGroups\",\n              \"type\": \"array\",\n              \"description\": \"filters group\",\n              \"required\": true,\n              \"items\": {\n                \"type\": \"object\",\n                \"description\": \"filters\",\n                \"properties\": [\n                  {\n                    \"id\": \"filters\",\n                    \"type\": \"array\",\n                    \"description\": \"filters\",\n                    \"required\": true,\n                    \"items\": {\n                      \"type\": \"object\",\n                      \"description\": \"filters\",\n                      \"properties\": [\n                        {\n                          \"id\": \"value\",\n                          \"type\": \"string\",\n                          \"description\": \"Set to the email provided by the user.

This guide will teach you how to implement an end-to-end simulation testing workflow using the simulate conversation endpoints ([batch](/docs/api-reference/agents/simulate-conversation) and [streaming](/docs/api-reference/agents/simulate-conversation-stream)), enabling you to granularly test and improve your agent's performance to ensure it meets your interaction goals.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- An agent configured in ElevenLabs Conversational AI ([create one here](/docs/conversational-ai/quickstart))\n- Your ElevenLabs API key, which you can [create in the dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys)\n\n## Implementing a Simulation Testing Workflow\n\n<Steps>\n\n<Step title=\"Identify initial evaluation parameters\">\nSearch through your agent's conversation history and find instances where your agent has underperformed. Use those conversations to create various prompts for a simulated user who will interact with your agent. Additionally, define any extra evaluation criteria not already specified in your agent configuration to test outcomes you may want for a specific simulated user.\n\n</Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Simulate the conversation via the SDK\">\nCreate a request to the simulation endpoint using the ElevenLabs SDK.\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```python title=\"Python\"\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom elevenlabs import (\n    ElevenLabs,\n    ConversationSimulationSpecification,\n    AgentConfig,\n    PromptAgent,\n    PromptEvaluationCriteria\n)\n\nload_dotenv()\napi_key = os.getenv(\"ELEVENLABS_API_KEY\")\nelevenlabs = ElevenLabs(api_key=api_key)\n\nresponse = elevenlabs.conversational_ai.agents.simulate_conversation(\n    agent_id=\"YOUR_AGENT_ID\",\n    simulation_specification=ConversationSimulationSpecification(\n        simulated_user_config=AgentConfig(\n            prompt=PromptAgent(\n                prompt=\"Your goal is to be a really difficult user.\",\n                llm=\"gpt-4o\",\n                temperature=0.5\n            )\n        )\n    ),\n    extra_evaluation_criteria=[\n        PromptEvaluationCriteria(\n            id=\"politeness_check\",\n            name=\"Politeness Check\",\n            conversation_goal_prompt=\"The agent was polite.\",\n            use_knowledge_base=False\n        )\n    ]\n)\n\nprint(response)\n\n```\n\n```typescript title=\"TypeScript\"\nimport { ElevenLabsClient } from '@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js';\nimport dotenv from 'dotenv';\n\ndotenv.config();\nconst apiKey = process.env.ELEVENLABS_API_KEY;\nconst elevenlabs = new ElevenLabsClient({\n  apiKey: apiKey,\n});\nconst response = await elevenlabs.conversationalAi.agents.simulateConversation('YOUR_AGENT_ID', {\n  simulationSpecification: {\n    simulatedUserConfig: {\n      prompt: {\n        prompt: 'Your goal is to be a really difficult user.',\n        llm: 'gpt-4o',\n        temperature: 0.5,\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  extraEvaluationCriteria: [\n    {\n      id: 'politeness_check',\n      name: 'Politeness Check',\n      conversationGoalPrompt: 'The agent was polite.',\n      useKnowledgeBase: false,\n    },\n  ],\n});\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(response, null, 4));\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\n<Note>\n  This is a basic example.

Identify any gaps or areas where the criteria may fall short in evaluating the agent's\n  performance. Refine and adjust the evaluation criteria accordingly to ensure they align with your\n  desired outcomes and accurately measure the agent's capabilities.\n</Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Improve your agent\">\n  Once you are confident in the accuracy of your evaluation criteria, use the learnings from\n  simulated conversations to enhance your agent's capabilities. Consider refining the system prompt\n  to better guide the agent's responses, ensuring they align with your objectives and user\n  expectations. Additionally, explore other features or configurations that could be optimized, such\n  as adjusting the agent's tone, improving its ability to handle specific queries, or integrating\n  additional data sources to enrich its responses. By systematically applying these learnings, you\n  can create a more robust and effective conversational agent that delivers a superior user\n  experience.\n</Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Continuous iteration\">\n  After completing an initial testing and improvement cycle, establishing a comprehensive testing\n  suite can be a great way to cover a broad range of possible scenarios. This suite can explore\n  multiple simulated conversations using varied simulated user prompts and starting conditions. By\n  continuously iterating and refining your approach, you can ensure your agent remains effective and\n  responsive to evolving user needs.\n</Step>\n\n</Steps>\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n#### Detailed Prompts and Criteria\n\nCrafting detailed and verbose simulated user prompts and evaluation criteria can enhance the effectiveness of the simulation tests. The more context and specificity you provide, the better the agent can understand and respond to complex interactions.\n\n#### Mock Tool Configurations\n\nUtilize mock tool configurations to test the decision-making process of your agent. This allows you to observe how the agent decides to make tool calls and react to different tool call results. For more details, check out the tool_mock_config input parameter from the [API reference](/docs/api-reference/agents/simulate-conversation#request.body.simulation_specification.tool_mock_config).\n\n#### Partial Conversation History\n\nUse partial conversation histories to evaluate how agents handle interactions from a specific point. This is particularly useful for assessing the agent's ability to manage conversations where the user has already set up a question in a specific way, or if there have been certain tool calls that have succeeded or failed. For more details, check out the partial_conversation_history input parameter from the [API reference](/docs/api-reference/agents/simulate-conversation#request.body.simulation_specification.partial_conversation_history).\n",

      "content": "---\ntitle: SIP trunking\nsubtitle: Connect your existing phone system with ElevenLabs conversational AI agents using SIP trunking\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nSIP (Session Initiation Protocol) trunking allows you to connect your existing telephony infrastructure directly to ElevenLabs conversational AI agents.\nThis integration enables enterprise customers to use their existing phone systems while leveraging ElevenLabs' advanced voice AI capabilities.\n\nWith SIP trunking, you can:\n\n- Connect your Private Branch Exchange (PBX) or SIP-enabled phone system to ElevenLabs' voice AI platform\n- Route calls to AI agents without changing your existing phone infrastructure\n- Handle both inbound and outbound calls\n- Leverage encrypted TLS transport and media encryption for enhanced security\n\n## How SIP trunking works\n\nSIP trunking establishes a direct connection between your telephony infrastructure and the ElevenLabs platform:\n\n1. **Inbound calls**: Calls from your SIP trunk are routed to the ElevenLabs platform using your configured SIP INVITE address.\n2. **Outbound calls**: Calls initiated by ElevenLabs are routed to your SIP trunk using your configured hostname, enabling your agents to make outgoing calls.\n3. **Authentication**: Connection security for the signaling is maintained through either digest authentication (username/password) or Access Control List (ACL) authentication based on the signaling source IP.\n4. **Signaling and Media**: The initial call setup (signaling) supports multiple transport protocols including TLS for encrypted communication. Once the call is established, the actual audio data (RTP stream) can be encrypted based on your media encryption settings.\n\n## Requirements\n\nBefore setting up SIP trunking, ensure you have:\n\n1.

Verify your SIP trunk configuration on both the ElevenLabs side and your provider side\n    2. Check that your firewall allows SIP signaling traffic on the configured transport protocol and port (5060 for UDP/TCP, 5061 for TLS)\n    3. Confirm that your address hostname is correctly formatted and accessible\n    4. Test with and without digest authentication credentials\n    5. If using TLS transport, ensure your provider's TLS certificates are valid and properly configured\n    6. Try different transport types (Auto, UDP, TCP) to isolate TLS-specific issues\n    \n  </Accordion>\n  <Accordion title=\"Authentication Failures\">\n    If calls are failing due to authentication issues:\n\n    1. Double-check your SIP trunk username and password if using digest authentication\n    2. Check your SIP trunk provider's logs for specific authentication error messages\n    3. Verify that custom headers, if configured, match your provider's requirements\n    4. Test with simplified configurations (no custom headers) to isolate authentication issues\n\n  </Accordion>\n  <Accordion title=\"TLS and Encryption Issues\">\n    If you're experiencing issues with TLS transport or media encryption:\n\n    1. Verify that your SIP trunk provider supports TLS transport on port 5061\n    2. Check certificate validity, expiration dates, and trust chains\n    3. Ensure your provider supports SRTP media encryption if using \"Required\" media encryption\n    4. Test with \"Allowed\" media encryption before using \"Required\" to isolate encryption issues\n    5. Try different transport types (TCP, UDP) to isolate TLS-specific problems\n    6. Contact your SIP trunk provider to confirm TLS and SRTP support\n\n  </Accordion>\n  <Accordion title=\"Custom Headers Issues\">\n    If you're having problems with custom headers:\n\n    1. Verify the exact header names and values required by your provider\n    2. Check for case sensitivity in header names\n    3. Ensure header values don't contain special characters that need escaping\n    4. Test without custom headers first, then add them incrementally\n    5. Review your provider's documentation for supported custom headers\n\n  </Accordion>\n  <Accordion title=\"No Audio or One-Way Audio\">\n    If the call connects but there's no audio or audio only flows one way:\n\n    1. Verify that your firewall allows UDP traffic for the RTP media stream (typically ports 10000-60000)\n    2. Since RTP uses dynamic IP addresses, ensure firewall rules are not restricted to specific static IPs\n    3. Check for Network Address Translation (NAT) issues that might be blocking the RTP stream\n    4. If using \"Required\" media encryption, ensure both endpoints support SRTP\n    5. Test with \"Disabled\" media encryption to isolate encryption-related audio issues\n\n  </Accordion>\n  <Accordion title=\"Audio Quality Issues\">\n    If you experience poor audio quality:\n\n    1. Ensure your network has sufficient bandwidth (at least 100 Kbps per call) and low latency/jitter for UDP traffic\n    2. Check for network congestion or packet loss, particularly on the UDP path\n    3. Verify codec settings match on both ends\n    4. If using media encryption, ensure both endpoints efficiently handle SRTP processing\n    5. Test with different media encryption settings to isolate quality issues\n\n  </Accordion>\n\n</AccordionGroup>\n\n## Limitations and Considerations\n\n- Support for multiple concurrent calls depends on your subscription tier\n- Call recording and analytics features are available but may require additional configuration\n- Outbound calling capabilities may be limited by your SIP trunk provider\n- **TLS Support**: Ensure your SIP trunk provider supports TLS 1.2 or higher for encrypted transport\n- **Media Encryption**: SRTP support varies by provider; verify compatibility before requiring encryption\n- **Audio format**: ElevenLabs' SIP deployment outputs and receives audio at **48kHz sample rate**. This is independent of any audio format configured on the agent for direct websocket connections. Your SIP trunk system must either support this format natively or perform resampling to match your system's requirements\n\n## FAQ\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"Can I use my existing phone numbers with ElevenLabs?\">\n    Yes, SIP trunking allows you to connect your existing phone numbers directly to ElevenLabs'\n    conversational AI platform without porting them.\n  </Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"What SIP trunk providers are compatible with ElevenLabs?\">\n  ElevenLabs is compatible with most standard SIP trunk providers including Twilio, Vonage,\n  RingCentral, Sinch, Infobip, Telnyx, Exotel, Plivo, Bandwidth, and others that support SIP\n  protocol standards.

This enables real-time, bi-directional audio streaming for use cases like PSTN calls, SIP trunks, and WebRTC clients.\n\n## How it works\n\nThe Node.js connector bridges Vonage and ElevenLabs:\n\n1.  Vonage initiates a WebSocket connection to the connector for an active call.\n2.  The connector establishes a WebSocket connection to the ElevenLabs Conversational AI endpoint.\n3.  Audio is relayed: Vonage (L16) -> Connector -> ElevenLabs (base64) and vice-versa.\n4.  The connector manages conversation events (`user_transcript`, `agent_response`, `interruption`).\n\n## Setup\n\n<Steps>\n\n### 1. Get ElevenLabs credentials\n\n- **API Key**: on the [ElevenLabs dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io/app), click \"My Account\" and then \"API Keys\" in the popup that appears.\n- **Agent ID**: Find the agent in the [Conversational AI dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/agents/). Once you have selected the agent click on the settings button and select \"Copy Agent ID\".\n\n### 2. Configure the connector\n\nClone the repository and set up the environment file.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/nexmo-se/elevenlabs-agent-ws-connector.git\ncd elevenlabs-agent-ws-connector\ncp .env.example .env\n```\n\nAdd your credentials to `.env`:\n\n```bash title=\".env\"\nELEVENLABS_API_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY;\nELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID = YOUR_AGENT_ID;\n```\n\nInstall dependencies: `npm install`.\n\n### 3. Expose the connector (local development)\n\nUse ngrok, or a similar service, to create a public URL for the connector (default port 6000).\n\n```bash\nngrok http 6000\n```\n\nNote the public `Forwarding` URL (e.g., `xxxxxxxx.ngrok-free.app`). **Do not include `https://`** when configuring Vonage.\n\n### 4. Run the connector\n\nStart the application:\n\n```bash\nnode elevenlabs-agent-ws-connector.cjs\n```\n\n### 5. Configure Vonage voice application\n\nYour Vonage app needs to connect to the connector's WebSocket endpoint (`wss://YOUR_CONNECTOR_HOSTNAME/socket`). This is the ngrok URL from step 3.\n\n- **Use Sample App**: Configure the [sample Vonage app](https://github.com/nexmo-se/voice-to-ai-engines) with `PROCESSOR_SERVER` set to your connector's hostname.\n- **Update Existing App**: Modify your [Nexmo Call Control Object](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference) to include a `connect` action targeting the connector's WebSocket URI (`wss://...`) with `content-type: audio/l16;rate=16000`. Pass necessary query parameters like `peer_uuid` and `webhook_url`.\n\n### 6. Test\n\nMake an inbound or outbound call via your Vonage application to interact with the ElevenLabs agent.\n\n</Steps>\n\n## Cloud deployment\n\nFor production, deploy the connector to a stable hosting provider (e.g., Vonage Cloud Runtime) with a public hostname.\n",

In another terminal, run `ngrok http --url=<your-url-here> 8000`.\n2. Make a request to the `/outbound-call` endpoint with the customer's phone number, the first message you want to use and the custom prompt:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://<your-ngrok-url>/outbound-call \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-d '{\n    \"prompt\": \"You are Eric, an outbound car sales agent. You are calling to sell a new car to the customer. Be friendly and professional and answer all questions.\",\n    \"first_message\": \"Hello Thor, my name is Eric, I heard you were looking for a new car! What model and color are you looking for?\",\n    \"number\": \"number-to-call\"\n    }'\n```\n\n3. You will see the call get initiated in your server terminal window and your phone will ring, starting the conversation once you answer.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n    <Accordion title=\"Connection Issues\">\n    If the WebSocket connection fails:\n    - Verify your ngrok URL is correct in Twilio settings\n    - Check that your server is running and accessible\n    - Ensure your firewall isn't blocking WebSocket connections\n    </Accordion>\n\n    <Accordion title=\"Audio Problems\">\n    If there's no audio output:\n    - Confirm your ElevenLabs API key is valid\n    - Verify the AGENT_ID is correct\n    - Check audio format settings match Twilio's requirements (μ-law 8kHz)\n    </Accordion>\n\n</AccordionGroup>\n\n## Security Best Practices\n\n<Warning>\n  Follow these security guidelines for production deployments:\n  <>\n    - Use environment variables for sensitive information - Implement proper authentication for your\n    endpoints - Use HTTPS for all communications - Regularly rotate API keys - Monitor usage to\n    prevent abuse\n  </>\n</Warning>\n",

This integration streamlines the support process by automatically checking for similar resolved issues, advising customers based on past resolutions, and securely creating new support tickets. Benefits include faster resolutions, reduced manual effort, and enhanced customer satisfaction.\n\n## Demo Video\n\nWatch the demonstration of the Zendesk + Conversational AI integration.\n\n<Frame background=\"subtle\" caption=\"Zendesk Integration Demo\">\n  <iframe\n    src=\"https://www.loom.com/embed/109404cb8aa348f5ab019feeec292c95?sid=87f90604-fb6e-421f-abed-09d571b6b46f\"\n    frameBorder=\"0\"\n    webkitallowfullscreen\n    mozallowfullscreen\n    allowFullScreen\n    style={{ width: '100%', height: '360px' }}\n  ></iframe>\n</Frame>\n\n## How it works\n\nWe lay out below how we have configured the Conversational AI agent to resolve tickets by using tool calling to step through the resolution process.\nEither view a step by step summary or view the detailed system prompt of the agent.\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"High level overview \">\n    <Steps>\n      <Step title=\"Initial Inquiry & Issue Details\">\n        Configure your agent to ask for a detailed description of the support issue and follow up with focused questions to gather all necessary information.\n      </Step>\n\n      <Step title=\"Check for Similar Issues\">\n        Configure the agent to check historical tickets for similar issues by:\n        - Using the `get_resolved_tickets` tool to fetch past tickets\n        - Finding similar tickets and their resolutions\n        - Extracting relevant comments via the `get_ticket_comments` tool\n        - Using this information to suggest proven solutions\n      </Step>\n\n      <Step title=\"Contact Information Collection\">\n        If the ticket can't be deflected:\n        - Collect and validate the customer's full name\n        - Verify email address accuracy\n        - Confirm any additional required fields for your Zendesk setup\n      </Step>\n\n      <Step title=\"Ticket Creation\">\n        - Use the `zendesk_open_ticket` tool after information verification\n        - Follow the ticket template structure\n        - Confirm ticket creation with the customer\n        - Inform them that support will be in touch\n      </Step>\n    </Steps>\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Detailed system prompt\">\n    ```\n    You are a helpful ElevenLabs support agent responsible for gathering information from users and creating support tickets using the zendesk_open_ticket tool. Be friendly, precise, and concise.\n\n    Begin by briefly asking asking for a detailed description of the problem.\n    Then, ask relevant support questions to gather additional details, one question at a time, and wait for the user's response before proceeding.\n\n    Once you have a description of the issue, say you will check if there are similar issues and any known resolutions.\n    - call get_resolved_tickets\n    - find the ticket which has the most similar issue to that of the caller\n    - call get_ticket_comments, using the result id from the previous response\n    - get any learnings from the resolution of this ticket\n\n    After this, tell the customer the recommended resolution from a previous similar issue. If they have already tried it or still want to move forward, move to the ticket creation step. Only provide resolution advice derived from the comments.\n\n    After capturing the support issue, gather the following contact details:\n    - The user's name.\n    - A valid email address for the requestor. Note that the email address is transcribed from voice, so ensure it is formatted correctly.\n    - Read the email back to the caller to confirm accuracy.\n\n    Once the email is confirmed, explain that you will create the ticket.\n    Create the ticket by using the Tool zendesk_open_ticket. Add these details to the ticket comment body.\n    Thank the customer and say support will be in touch.\n\n    Clarifications:\n    - Do not inform the user that you are formatting the email; simply do it.\n    - If the caller asks you to move forward with creating the ticket, do so with the existing information.\n\n    Guardrails:\n    - Do not speak about topics outside of support issues with ElevenLabs.\n    ```\n\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n<Tip>\n  This integration enhances efficiency by leveraging historical support data. All API calls require\n  proper secret handling in the authorization headers.\n</Tip>\n\n## Authentication Setup\n\nBefore configuring the tools, you must set up authentication with Zendesk.\n\n### Step 1: Generate Zendesk API Token\n\n1. Log into your Zendesk admin panel\n2. Go to **Admin → Channels → API**\n3. Enable **Token access** if not already enabled\n4. Click **Add API token**\n5. Copy the generated token - you'll need it for the next step\n\n### Step 2: Create Authentication Secret\n\nThe Zendesk API requires Basic authentication. You need to create a properly formatted secret:\n\n1. **Format your credentials** using this pattern:\n\n   ```\n   {your_email}/token:{your_api_token}\n   ```\n\n   **Example:**\n\n   ```\n   jdoe@example.com/token:6wiIBWbGkBMo1mRDMuVwkw1EPsNkeUj95PIz2akv\n   ```\n\n2. **Base64 encode** the formatted string\n\n   - You can use the command line option: `echo -n \"your_string\" | base64`\n\n3. **Create the final secret value** by adding \"Basic \" prefix:\n\n   ```\n   Basic amRvZUBleGFtcGxlLmNvbS90b2tlbjo2d2lJQldiR2tCTW8xbVJETXVWd2t3MUVQc05rZVVqOTVQSXoyYWt2\n   ```\n\n4. **Save this as a secret** in your agent's secrets with name `zendesk_key`\n\n## Tool Configurations\n\nThe integration with zendesk employs three webhook tools to create the support agent. Use the tabs below to review each tool's configuration.\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"zendesk_get_ticket_comments\">\n    **Name:** zendesk_get_ticket_comments  \n    **Description:** Retrieves the comments of a ticket.  \n    **Method:** GET  \n    **URL:** `https://your-subdomain.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/{ticket_id}/comments.json`\n    \n    **Headers:**\n    -

This enables us to track performance, identify areas for improvement, and maintain high-quality support standards.\n\n## Impact\n\nWith this integration in place, not only can you resolve tickets faster, but you can also reduce the load on your support team by deflecting tickets that are not relevant to your team.\n\nIn addition, you can use the Conversational AI platform to monitor the agent's usage.\n\n<Frame\n  background=\"subtle\"\n  caption=\"Get a high-level overview of each conversation and listen to the conversation's audio recording.\"\n>\n  <img\n    src=\"/assets/images/conversational-ai/zendesk_conv_overview.png\"\n    alt=\"Support agent conversation summary\"\n  />\n</Frame>\n\n<Frame\n  background=\"subtle\"\n  caption=\"Track how well the AI agent performs against key evaluation criteria like issue relevance, sentiment, and resolution success.\"\n>\n  <img\n    src=\"/assets/images/conversational-ai/zendesk_criteria_eval.png\"\n    alt=\"Evaluation criteria for support interactions\"\n  />\n</Frame>\n\n<Frame\n  background=\"subtle\"\n  caption=\"Monitor the data collected during each interaction, including tools used, issue details, and customer information.\"\n>\n  <img\n    src=\"/assets/images/conversational-ai/zendesk_data_collection.png\"\n    alt=\"Data collection parameters from conversation transcripts\"\n  />\n</Frame>\n\n<Frame\n  background=\"subtle\"\n  caption=\"Review detailed transcripts of conversations to understand agent performance, tool usage and customer interactions.\"\n>\n  <img\n    src=\"/assets/images/conversational-ai/zendesk_transcript.png\"\n    alt=\"Detailed conversation transcript example\"\n  />\n</Frame>\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n- Use HTTPS endpoints for all webhook calls.\n- Store sensitive values as secrets using the ElevenLabs Secrets Manager.\n- Validate that all authorization headers follow the required format.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis guide details how to integrate Zendesk into our conversational AI platform for efficient support ticket management. By leveraging webhook tools and historical support data, the integration streamlines the support process, reducing resolution times and enhancing overall service quality.\n\nFor additional details on tool configuration or other integrations, refer to the [Tools Overview](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/tools/server-tools).\n",

This allows businesses to leverage our advanced voice AI technology while limiting the processing of data outside of the EEA.\n\n<Note>\n  With EU residency enabled, Gemini, Claude and OpenAI LLMs as well as custom LLMs are available in\n  Conversational AI.\n</Note>\n\nEnabling European data residency may also provide the benefit of reduced latency for users located in Europe due to localized data processing\n\n<Note>\n  European data residency is an Enterprise-specific feature. For details on enabling this for your\n  organization, please see the \"Getting Access\" section below.\n</Note>\n\nA Data Processing Addendum (DPA) is made available to all customers to the extent required under applicable data protection laws. The DPA is [publicly linked online](https://elevenlabs.io/dpa) and is incorporated by reference into our Terms of Service for self-serve users. For enterprise customers, the DPA is incorporated into their customer agreements.\n\n## Core Compliance Features\n\nEuropean data residency complements ElevenLabs' existing suite of security and compliance measures designed to safeguard customer data:\n\n- **GDPR Compliance**: Our platform and practices are designed to align with GDPR principles, including measures designed to ensure lawful data processing, adherence to data subject rights, and the implementation of appropriate security measures.\n- **SOC2 Certification**: ElevenLabs maintains SOC2 certification, demonstrating our commitment to high standards for security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.\n- **Zero Retention Mode (Optional)**: Customers can enable Zero Retention Mode, ensuring that sensitive content and data processed by our models are not retained on ElevenLabs servers. This is a powerful feature for minimizing data footprint.\n- **End-to-End Encryption**: Data transmitted to and from ElevenLabs models is protected by end-to-end encryption, securing it in transit.\n- **HIPAA Compliance**: For qualifying healthcare enterprises, ElevenLabs offers Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) and HIPAA-compliant configurations for its HIPAA-eligible services.\n\n## How European Data Residency Works\n\nWhen European data residency is enabled for an Enterprise account:\n\n1.  **Data Localization**: Relevant customer data associated with the use of our voice AI services is processed and stored within data centers located in the European Union.\n2.  **Compliance with Sovereignty**: This localization is designed to help organizations meet regional data sovereignty mandates and regulatory obligations.\n3.  **Standard Functionality**: European data residency operates seamlessly with ElevenLabs' core platform features, ensuring you receive the same high-quality AI audio generation and capabilities.\n\n<Info>\n  In some instances, data may nevertheless be processed outside of the EEA or Switzerland. The\n  specific scope of data covered by European data residency will be detailed in your Enterprise\n  agreement. Configuration of this feature is managed at the organizational level by ElevenLabs.\n</Info>\n\n## Getting Access\n\nEuropean data residency is an exclusive feature available to ElevenLabs Enterprise customers.\n\n- **Existing Enterprise Customers**: If you are an existing Enterprise customer, please contact your dedicated Customer Success Manager or reach out to our support team to discuss enabling European data residency for your account.\n- **New Customers**: Organizations interested in ElevenLabs Enterprise and requiring European data residency should [contact our sales team](https://elevenlabs.io/contact-sales) to discuss specific needs and implementation.\n\n## Developer Considerations\n\nThe European data residency environment is a separate ElevenLabs platforms available at\n`https://eu.residency.elevenlabs.io` - rerouting to the correct region **isn't done automatically**.\nOur team will set you up with a fresh account.\n\n- **API Endpoints**: Standard API endpoints and integration methods remain the same. However, you will need to use\n  API keys linked to your European data residency account. For API calls, you will need to hit the EU API with the\n  base URL `https://api.eu.residency.elevenlabs.io`. This ensures that all requests are processed within the European data residency environment.\n- **Data Handling**: While ElevenLabs manages the residency of data on our servers in accordance with your Enterprise agreement, developers should continue to adhere to best practices for data handling and GDPR compliance within their own applications and systems. This includes aspects like obtaining user consent, managing data subject rights requests, and ensuring data minimization.\n- **Zero Retention Mode**: Consider using Zero Retention Mode in conjunction with European data residency if minimizing data storage on ElevenLabs servers is a critical requirement for your use case.\n\n## FAQ\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"What specific data is covered by European data residency?\">\n    The scope of data subject to European data residency typically includes content processed by our\n    AI models (e.g., text submitted for TTS, audio generated) and associated metadata. Specific\n    details are provided in the Enterprise agreement.\n  </Accordion>\n  <Accordion title=\"Does European data residency impact API performance?\">\n    For users in Europe, data residency may potentially reduce latency due to localized processing.\n    For users outside Europe, performance should remain consistent with our global infrastructure.\n    The primary aim is compliance and data sovereignty.\n  </Accordion>\n  <Accordion title=\"Is Zero Retention Mode automatically enabled with European data residency?\">\n    No, Zero Retention Mode is an optional feature that can be enabled separately, even for accounts\n    with European data residency. It provides an additional layer of data minimization by preventing\n    storage of content on our servers.\n  </Accordion>\n  <Accordion title=\"How does this relate to GDPR compliance?\">\n    European data residency directly supports GDPR compliance by helping organizations meet\n    requirements related to data localization and cross-border data transfers. GDPR compliance\n    itself is a broader commitment involving various data protection principles and practices that\n    ElevenLabs adheres to.\n  </Accordion>\n  <Accordion title=\"Do I need to change my API calls or SDK usage?\">\n    Yes, the API base URL will change to `https://api.eu.residency.elevenlabs.io` and you will need\n    to use API keys associated with your European data residency account. For the SDK, you can\n    change the base URL by changing the environment parameter when you initialize the client. Other\n    than that, the API functionality remains consistent.\n  </Accordion>\n</AccordionGroup>\n\n## Related Resources\n\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\n  <Card\n    title=\"Conversational AI Security\"\n    href=\"/docs/conversational-ai/customization/authentication\"\n  >\n    Learn more about securing your Conversational AI agents.\n  </Card>\n  <Card title=\"HIPAA Compliance\" href=\"/docs/conversational-ai/legal/hipaa\">\n    Understand our HIPAA-eligible services and BAAs for healthcare applications.\n  </Card>\n  <Card title=\"ElevenLabs Compliance Portal\" href=\"https://compliance.elevenlabs.io/\">\n    Visit our Compliance Portal for comprehensive information on our certifications and practices.\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n",

Please refer to our [compliance page](https://compliance.elevenlabs.io/) for the latest information.\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nElevenLabs Conversational AI is one of ElevenLabs' HIPAA-eligible services, and we offer Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) to eligible customers. To the extent Covered Entities and Business Associates, as defined under HIPAA, have executed a BAA and have Zero Retention Mode engaged, ElevenLabs allows such customers to develop AI-powered voice agents for the handling Protected Health Information (PHI). The application of Zero Retention Mode is designed to promote compliance with HIPAA by limiting the processing of such PHI. You can read more about [Zero Retention Mode here](/docs/resources/zero-retention-mode).\n\n## Controls designed to promote HIPAA compliance\n\nWhen HIPAA compliance is required for a workspace, and to the extent a BAA has been executed with ElevenLabs, the following policies are enabled:\n\n1. **Zero Retention Mode** - You can read more about [Zero Retention Mode here](/docs/resources/zero-retention-mode)\n2. **LLM Provider Restrictions** - Only LLM from providers with whom we have a BAA in place are available as preconfigured options\n3. **Storage Limitations** - Raw audio files and transcripts containing PHI are not retained\n\n<Note>\n\nIf you want to use LLMs that aren't available preconfigured in Zero Retention Mode, you can still use them in Conversational AI by:\n\n1. Arranging to sign a BAA directly with the LLM provider you'd like to use\n2. Using your API key with our Custom LLM integration\n\n</Note>\n\nTo the extent Zero Retention Mode is engaged, ElevenLabs' platform is designed to ensure that PHI shared as part of a conversation is not stored or logged in any system component, including:\n\n- Conversation transcripts\n- Audio recordings\n- Tool calls and results\n- Data analytics\n- System logs\n\n<Warning>\n  For Conversational AI, your BAA applies only to the extent provided therein. To the extent you\n  wish to forego Zero Retention Mode with respect to any Conversational AI agent, no PHI should be\n  submitted to the Service in connection therewith, and such agent is no longer deemed a covered\n  service for purposes of the BAA. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, while ElevenLabs'\n  Conversational AI Service, coupled with Zero Retention Mode, is designed to promote compliance\n  with HIPAA, you are fully responsible for ensuring compliance with all obligations applicable to\n  you and for ensuring your use of the Services is compliant with all applicable laws.\n</Warning>\n\n## Enterprise customers\n\n<Note>\n  Execution of a BAA, as may be required by HIPAA, is only available for Enterprise tier\n  subscriptions. Contact your account representative to discuss further. PHI should not be submitted\n  to the ElevenLabs Services unless a BAA is in place and only to the extent permitted under such\n  BAA.\n</Note>\n\n## Available LLMs\n\nWhen operating in Zero Retention Mode, only the following LLMs are available:\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"Google Models\">\n    - Gemini 2.0 Flash - Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite - Gemini 1.5 Flash - Gemini 1.5 Pro - Gemini 1.0 Pro\n  </Accordion>\n  <Accordion title=\"Anthropic Models\">\n    - Claude 3.7 Sonnet - Claude 3.5 Sonnet - Claude 3.0 Haiku\n  </Accordion>\n  <Accordion title=\"Custom LLMs\">\n    - [Custom LLM](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/llm/custom-llm) (supports any OpenAI-API\n    compatible provider and requires you to bring your own API keys)\n  </Accordion>\n</AccordionGroup>\n\n## Technical implementation\n\nZero Retention Mode implements several safeguards and is designed to:\n\n1. **LLM Allowlist** - Prevent use of LLMs except as provided above\n2. **PII Redaction** - Automatically redact sensitive fields before storage\n3. **Storage Prevention** - Disable uploading of raw audio files to cloud\n\n## Developer experience\n\nWhen working with Zero Retention Mode agents:\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"LLMs (except the available LLMs as described above) are disabled in the UI\">\n    <Frame\n      background=\"subtle\"\n      caption=\"The UI shows disabled LLM options with tooltip explanations\"\n    >\n      ![Redacted conversation analysis showing Zero Retention Mode in\n      action](/assets/images/conversational-ai/hipaa-model.png)\n    </Frame>\n  </Step>\n  <Step title=\"Content is redacted from content history\">\n    <Frame\n      background=\"subtle\"\n      caption=\"All sensitive information contained within the prompt or output is redacted and not stored\"\n    >\n      ![Redacted conversation history showing Zero Retention Mode in\n      action](/assets/images/conversational-ai/redacted.png)\n    </Frame>\n  </Step>\n  <Step title=\"Conversation analysis is limited\">\n    <Frame\n      background=\"subtle\"\n      caption=\"Minimal information is visible to ElevenLabs given Zero Retention Mode\"\n    >\n      ![Redacted conversation analysis showing HIPAA compliance in\n      action](/assets/images/conversational-ai/redacted-summary.png)\n    </Frame>\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n### API restrictions are enforced\n\nAPI calls attempting to use unavailable LLMs will receive an HTTP 400 error. Analytics data will be limited to non-sensitive metrics only.\n\n## FAQ\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"Can I use any LLM if I am subject to HIPAA?\">\n    No. In such case, you can only use LLMs from the approved list. Attempts to use other LLMs will\n    produce an error. You can always use a custom LLM if you need a specific model not on the\n    allowlist.\n  </Accordion>\n  <Accordion title=\"Can I execute a BAA with ElevenLabs if I am subject to HIPAA?\">\n    BAAs are only available to enterprise customers. Please refer to your account executive to\n    discuss further.\n  </Accordion>\n  <Accordion title=\"Does the application of Zero Retention Mode affect conversation quality?\">\n    No. Zero Retention Mode and the execution of a BAA only affects how data is stored and which\n    LLMs can be used. It does not impact the quality or functionality of conversations while they\n    are active.\n  </Accordion>\n  <Accordion title=\"Can I still analyze conversation data?\">\n    Yes, but with limitations. Conversation analytics will only include non-sensitive metadata like\n    call duration and success rates. Specific content from conversations will not be available.\n  </Accordion>\n</AccordionGroup>\n\n## Considerations\n\nWhen building voice agents, you may consider:\n\n1. **Use Custom LLMs** when possible, which may provide enhanced control over data processing\n2. **Implement proper authentication** for all healthcare applications\n3. **Validate configuration** is correct by checking redaction before launching + passing PHI\n\n## Related resources\n\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\n  <Card\n    title=\"Conversational AI Security\"\n    href=\"/docs/conversational-ai/customization/authentication\"\n  >\n    Learn about securing your Conversational AI agents\n  </Card>\n  <Card title=\"Custom LLM Integration\" href=\"/docs/conversational-ai/customization/llm/custom-llm\">\n    Set up your own LLM for maximum control and compliance\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n",

This guide does not\n  constitute legal advice. The TCPA is complex and subject to interpretation. Consult with qualified\n  legal counsel to ensure your specific use of ElevenLabs Conversational AI for outbound calling\n  complies with all applicable laws and regulations. Visit our [Compliance Portal](https://elevenlabs.io/compliance) for comprehensive information on\n  our certifications and practices.\n\n</Warning>\n\nThis guide provides a high-level overview of certain key requirements under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) for developers and businesses using ElevenLabs Conversational AI for outbound calls in the United States. Adherence to the TCPA is critical when making automated calls or using AI-generated voices for outbound communications.\n\n<Note>\n  The TCPA primarily governs **outbound** calls and texts. It does not generally apply to inbound\n  communications initiated by the consumer. In addition to complying with the TCPA, you must also\n  comply with all applicable state-level laws that may govern telemarketing, automated calls, or the\n  use of AI-generated voices. Many states have enacted their own regulations that may be more\n  restrictive than federal requirements.\n</Note>\n\n## Types of Consent Required\n\nThe type of consent needed under the TCPA depends on whether your outbound call using ElevenLabs AI voice is classified as **marketing** or **non-marketing**. ElevenLabs' AI-generated voices are considered \"artificial or prerecorded voices\" under the TCPA, triggering specific consent rules.\n\n| Call Type using ElevenLabs AI          | Consent Required                         | Consent Requirements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Sample Consent Disclosure Language (Illustrative)                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| :------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Marketing Call**                     | **Prior Express Written Consent (PEWC)** | 1. A **signed written agreement** from the recipient (electronic signatures under E-SIGN Act are valid).<br /><br />2. The agreement must feature a **clear and conspicuous disclosure** stating that:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (A) The recipient authorizes _[Your Company Name]_ to make automated calls using an artificial/prerecorded voice to the specific phone number provided; **AND**<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (B) Consent is **not** a condition of purchasing any goods or services. | \"By checking this box and providing my phone number, I agree to receive automated marketing calls from [Your Company Name], including using an AI-generated voice, at the number provided. Consent is not a condition of any purchase.\" |\n| **Non-Marketing / Informational Call** | **Prior Express Consent (PEC)**          | The consumer must have given permission to be contacted at the number provided for informational purposes (e.g., providing a phone number for appointment reminders or account updates). While not always requiring a written agreement like PEWC, consent must still be express and affirmative.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | \"Please provide your phone number if you'd like to receive [e.g., appointment reminders, service updates] from _[Your Company Name]_, including automated calls using an AI-generated voice.\"                                           |\n\n<Note>\n  \\*Signatures for PEWC can comply with the E-SIGN Act (e.g., via website form submission, email\n  confirmation, or a recorded telephone keypress after clear disclosure).\n</Note>\n\n## Key Compliance Guidelines for Developers\n\nWhen using ElevenLabs Conversational AI for outbound calling:\n\n1.  **Affirmative Opt-In**: Consent must be affirmative. Pre-checked boxes for consent are not compliant.\n2.  **Consent Revocation**: Consumers can revoke consent at any time through \"any reasonable manner\" (e.g., verbal request during a call, email, text reply like \"STOP\").\n    - Ensure your system, especially interactive AI, can recognize and process opt-out requests, for example using our [end call tool](/docs/)\n    - Honor revocations promptly, and in all cases within 10 business days..\n3.  **Record Keeping**: Maintain clear records of all obtained consents (who, when, where, and how consent was given) and any revocations. The burden of proving consent is on the caller.\n4.  **Calling Time Restrictions**: Outbound calls to residential numbers are restricted to 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. in the recipient's local time zone. Implement time-zone awareness.\n5.  **Do-Not-Call (DNC) Lists**:\n    - Maintain an internal DNC list of individuals who have asked not to be called.\n    - For marketing calls, scrub lists against the National DNC Registry, unless an exception (like valid PEWC) applies.\n6.  **Identify the Caller**: Clearly state the name of the company at the beginning of the call.\n7.  **Provide a Callback Number**: Share a toll-free number that recipients can use to opt out of future calls.\n8.  **Enable Automated Opt-Outs for Promotional Calls**: For promotional calls, provide an automated opt-out mechanism within two seconds of identifying the company. Include brief instructions on how to use it. If the recipient opts out, the system must (i) immediately end the call and (ii) record the number on the company's internal opt-out list. If leaving a voicemail, include a toll-free number that connects to an automated opt-out system with the same functionality.\n\n## Understanding \"Marketing\"\n\nUnder the TCPA, a call is generally considered **\"marketing\"** if its purpose is to:\n\n- Encourage the purchase or rental of, or investment in, property, goods, or services.\n- Advertise the commercial availability or quality of any property, goods, or services.\n\nIf your call includes any promotional content, it will likely be classified as marketing, requiring PEWC.\n",

Consider explaining and allowing microphone access in your apps UI before the Conversation kicks off:\n\n```js\n// call after explaining to the user why the microphone access is needed\nawait navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true });\n```\n\n#### Session configuration\n\nThe options passed to `startSession` specifiy how the session is established. There are two ways to start a session:\n\n**Using Agent ID**\n\nAgent ID can be acquired through [ElevenLabs UI](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai).\nFor public agents, you can use the ID directly:\n\n```js\nconst conversation = await Conversation.startSession({\n  agentId: '<your-agent-id>',\n});\n```\n\n**Using a signed URL**\n\nIf the conversation requires authorization, you will need to add a dedicated endpoint to your server that\nwill request a signed url using the [ElevenLabs API](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/introduction) and pass it back to the client.\n\nHere's an example of how it could be set up:\n\n```js\n// Node.js server\n\napp.get('/signed-url', yourAuthMiddleware, async (req, res) => {\n  const response = await fetch(\n    `https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/conversation/get-signed-url?agent_id=${process.env.AGENT_ID}`,\n    {\n      method: 'GET',\n      headers: {\n        // Requesting a signed url requires your ElevenLabs API key\n        // Do NOT expose your API key to the client!\n        'xi-api-key': process.env.XI_API_KEY,\n      },\n    }\n  );\n\n  if (!response.ok) {\n    return res.status(500).send('Failed to get signed URL');\n  }\n\n  const body = await response.json();\n  res.send(body.signed_url);\n});\n```\n\n```js\n// Client\n\nconst response = await fetch('/signed-url', yourAuthHeaders);\nconst signedUrl = await response.text();\n\nconst conversation = await Conversation.startSession({ signedUrl });\n```\n\n#### Optional callbacks\n\nThe options passed to `startSession` can also be used to register optional callbacks:\n\n- **onConnect** - handler called when the conversation websocket connection is established.\n- **onDisconnect** - handler called when the conversation websocket connection is ended.\n- **onMessage** - handler called when a new text message is received. These can be tentative or final transcriptions of user voice, replies produced by LLM. Primarily used for handling conversation transcription.\n- **onError** - handler called when an error is encountered.\n- **onStatusChange** - handler called whenever connection status changes. Can be `connected`, `connecting` and `disconnected` (initial).\n- **onModeChange** - handler called when a status changes, eg. agent switches from `speaking` to `listening`, or the other way around.\n\n#### Return value\n\n`startSession` returns a `Conversation` instance that can be used to control the session. The method will throw an error if the session cannot be established. This can happen if the user denies microphone access, or if the websocket connection\nfails.\n\n**endSession**\n\nA method to manually end the conversation. The method will end the conversation and disconnect from websocket.\nAfterwards the conversation instance will be unusable and can be safely discarded.\n\n```js\nawait conversation.endSession();\n```\n\n**getId**\n\nA method returning the conversation ID.\n\n```js\nconst id = conversation.getId();\n```\n\n**setVolume**\n\nA method to set the output volume of the conversation. Accepts object with volume field between 0 and 1.\n\n```js\nawait conversation.setVolume({ volume: 0.5 });\n```\n\n**getInputVolume / getOutputVolume**\n\nMethods that return the current input/output volume on a scale from `0` to `1` where `0` is -100 dB and `1` is -30 dB.\n\n```js\nconst inputVolume = await conversation.getInputVolume();\nconst outputVolume = await conversation.getOutputVolume();\n```\n\n**getInputByteFrequencyData / getOutputByteFrequencyData**\n\nMethods that return `Uint8Array`s containg the current input/output frequency data. See [AnalyserNode.getByteFrequencyData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AnalyserNode/getByteFrequencyData) for more information.\n",

Those are all optional.\n\n```tsx\nconst conversation = useConversation({\n  /* options object */\n});\n```\n\n- **onConnect** - handler called when the conversation websocket connection is established.\n- **onDisconnect** - handler called when the conversation websocket connection is ended.\n- **onMessage** - handler called when a new message is received. These can be tentative or final transcriptions of user voice, replies produced by LLM, or debug message when a debug option is enabled.\n- **onError** - handler called when a error is encountered.\n\n#### Methods\n\n**startSession**\n\n`startSession` method kick off the websocket connection and starts using microphone to communicate with the ElevenLabs Conversational AI agent.\nThe method accepts options object, with the `url` or `agentId` option being required.\n\nAgent ID can be acquired through [ElevenLabs UI](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai) and is always necessary.\n\n```js\nconst conversation = useConversation();\nconst conversationId = await conversation.startSession({ url });\n```\n\nFor the public agents, define `agentId` - no signed link generation necessary.\n\nIn case the conversation requires authorization, use the REST API to generate signed links. Use the signed link as a `url` parameter.\n\n`startSession` returns promise resolving to `conversationId`. The value is a globally unique conversation ID you can use to identify separate conversations.\n\n```js\n// your server\nconst requestHeaders: HeadersInit = new Headers();\nrequestHeaders.set(\"xi-api-key\", process.env.XI_API_KEY); // use your ElevenLabs API key\n\nconst response = await fetch(\n  \"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/conversation/get-signed-url?agent_id={{agent id created through ElevenLabs UI}}\",\n  {\n    method: \"GET\",\n    headers: requestHeaders,\n  }\n);\n\nif (!response.ok) {\n  return Response.error();\n}\n\nconst body = await response.json();\nconst url = body.signed_url; // use this URL for startSession method.\n```\n\n**endSession**\n\nA method to manually end the conversation. The method will end the conversation and disconnect from websocket.\n\n```js\nawait conversation.endSession();\n```\n\n**setVolume**\n\nA method to set the output volume of the conversation. Accepts object with volume field between 0 and 1.\n\n```js\nawait conversation.setVolume({ volume: 0.5 });\n```\n\n**status**\n\nA React state containing the current status of the conversation.\n\n```js\nconst { status } = useConversation();\nconsole.log(status); // \"connected\" or \"disconnected\"\n```\n\n**isSpeaking**\n\nA React state containing the information of whether the agent is currently speaking.\nThis is helpful for indicating the mode in your UI.\n\n```js\nconst { isSpeaking } = useConversation();\nconsole.log(isSpeaking); // boolean\n```\n",

Open your project in Xcode\n    2. Go to `File` > `Add Packages...`\n    3. Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/elevenlabs/ElevenLabsSwift`\n    4. Select your desired version\n  </>\n\n  </Step>\n  <Step title=\"Import the SDK\">\n   <>\n     ```swift\n     import ElevenLabsSDK\n      ```\n   </>\n\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n<Warning>\n  Ensure you add `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` to your Info.plist to explain microphone access to\n  users.\n</Warning>\n\n## Usage\n\nThis library is primarily designed for Conversational AI integration in Swift applications. Please use an alternative dependency for other features, such as speech synthesis.\n\n### Initialize Conversation\n\nFirst, create a session configuration and set up the necessary callbacks:\n\n```swift\n// Configure the session\nlet config = ElevenLabsSDK.SessionConfig(agentId: \"your-agent-id\")\n\n// Set up callbacks\nvar callbacks = ElevenLabsSDK.Callbacks()\ncallbacks.onConnect = { conversationId in\n    print(\"Connected with ID: \\(conversationId)\")\n}\ncallbacks.onDisconnect = {\n    print(\"Disconnected\")\n}\ncallbacks.onMessage = { message, role in\n    print(\"\\(role.rawValue): \\(message)\")\n}\ncallbacks.onError = { error, info in\n    print(\"Error: \\(error), Info: \\(String(describing: info))\")\n}\ncallbacks.onStatusChange = { status in\n    print(\"Status changed to: \\(status.rawValue)\")\n}\ncallbacks.onModeChange = { mode in\n    print(\"Mode changed to: \\(mode.rawValue)\")\n}\ncallbacks.onVolumeUpdate = { volume in\n    print(\"Volume updated: \\(volume)\")\n}\n```\n\n### Session Configuration\n\nThere are two ways to initialize a session:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Using Agent ID\">\n    You can obtain an Agent ID through the [ElevenLabs UI](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai):\n    ```swift\n    let config = ElevenLabsSDK.SessionConfig(agentId: \"<your-agent-id>\")\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab title=\"Using Signed URL\">\n    For conversations requiring authorization, implement a server endpoint that requests a signed URL:\n    ```swift\n    // Swift example using URLSession\n    func getSignedUrl() async throws -> String {\n        let url = URL(string: \"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/conversation/get-signed-url\")!\n        var request = URLRequest(url: url)\n        request.setValue(\"YOUR-API-KEY\", forHTTPHeaderField: \"xi-api-key\")\n\n        let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(for: request)\n        let response = try JSONDecoder().decode(SignedUrlResponse.self, from: data)\n        return response.signedUrl\n    }\n\n    // Use the signed URL\n    let signedUrl = try await getSignedUrl()\n    let config = ElevenLabsSDK.SessionConfig(signedUrl: signedUrl)\n    ```\n\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n### Client Tools\n\nClient Tools allow you to register custom functions that can be called by your AI agent during conversations. This enables your agent to perform actions in your application.\n\n#### Registering Tools\n\nRegister custom tools before starting a conversation:\n\n```swift\n// Create client tools instance\nvar clientTools = ElevenLabsSDK.ClientTools()\n\n// Register a custom tool with an async handler\nclientTools.register(\"generate_joke\") { parameters async throws -> String? in\n    // Parameters is a [String: Any] dictionary\n    guard let joke = parameters[\"joke\"] as? String else {\n        throw ElevenLabsSDK.ClientToolError.invalidParameters\n    }\n    print(\"generate_joke tool received joke: \\(joke)\")\n\n    return joke\n}\n```\n\n<Info>\n  Remember to setup your agent with the client-tools in the ElevenLabs UI. See the [Client Tools\n  documentation](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/tools/client-tools) for setup instructions.\n</Info>\n\n### Starting the Conversation\n\nInitialize the conversation session asynchronously:\n\n```swift\nTask {\n    do {\n        let conversation = try await ElevenLabsSDK.Conversation.startSession(\n            config: config,\n            callbacks: callbacks,\n            clientTools: clientTools // Optional: pass the previously configured client tools\n        )\n        // Use the conversation instance\n    } catch {\n        print(\"Failed to start conversation: \\(error)\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<Note>\n  The client tools parameter is optional. If you don't need custom tools, you can omit it when\n  starting the session.\n</Note>\n\n### Audio Sample Rates\n\nThe ElevenLabs SDK currently uses a default input sample rate of `16,000 Hz`. However, the output sample rate is configurable based on the agent's settings. Ensure that the output sample rate aligns with your specific application's audio requirements for smooth interaction.\n\n<Note>\n\nThe SDK does not currently support ulaw format for audio encoding. For compatibility, consider using alternative formats.\n\n</Note>\n\n### Managing the Session\n\n<CodeGroup>\n  ```swift:End Session\n  // Starts the session\n  conversation.startSession()\n  // Ends the session\n  conversation.endSession()\n  ```\n\n```swift:Recording Controls\n// Start recording\nconversation.startRecording()\n\n// Stop recording\nconversation.stopRecording()\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\n### Example Implementation\n\nFor a full, working example, check out the [example application on GitHub](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-examples/tree/main/examples/conversational-ai/swift).\n\nHere's an example SwiftUI view implementing the conversation interface:\n\n```swift\nstruct ConversationalAIView: View {\n    @State private var conversation: ElevenLabsSDK.Conversation?\n    @State private var mode: ElevenLabsSDK.Mode = .listening\n    @State private var status: ElevenLabsSDK.Status = .disconnected\n    @State private var audioLevel: Float = 0.0\n\n    private func startConversation() {\n        Task {\n            do {\n                let config = ElevenLabsSDK.SessionConfig(agentId: \"your-agent-id\")\n                var callbacks = ElevenLabsSDK.Callbacks()\n\n                callbacks.onConnect = { conversationId in\n                    status = .connected\n                }\n                callbacks.onDisconnect = {\n                    status = .disconnected\n                }\n                callbacks.onModeChange = { newMode in\n                    DispatchQueue.main.async {\n                        mode = newMode\n                    }\n                }\n                callbacks.onVolumeUpdate = { newVolume in\n                    DispatchQueue.main.async {\n                        audioLevel = newVolume\n                    }\n                }\n\n                conversation = try await ElevenLabsSDK.Conversation.startSession(\n                    config: config,\n                    callbacks: callbacks\n                )\n            } catch {\n                print(\"Failed to start conversation: \\(error)\")\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    var body: some View {\n        VStack {\n            // Your UI implementation\n            Button(action: startConversation) {\n                Text(status == .connected ? \"End Call\" : \"Start Call\")\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<Note>\n  This SDK is currently experimental and under active development. While it's stable enough for\n  testing and development, it's not recommended for production use yet.\n</Note>\n",

This optimization means that extended periods of silence are charged at 5% of the usual per-minute cost.\n\nThis reduction in cost:\n\n- Only applies to the period of silence.\n- Does not apply after voice activity is detected again.\n- Can be triggered at multiple times in the same conversation.\n\n## Models\n\nCurrently, the following models are natively supported and can be configured via the agent settings:\n\n| Provider      | Model                 |\n| ------------- | --------------------- |\n| **Google**    | Gemini 2.5 Flash      |\n|               | Gemini 2.0 Flash      |\n|               | Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite |\n|               | Gemini 1.5 Flash      |\n|               | Gemini 1.5 Pro        |\n| **OpenAI**    | GPT-4.1               |\n|               | GPT-4.1 Mini          |\n|               | GPT-4.1 Nano          |\n|               | GPT-4o                |\n|               | GPT-4o Mini           |\n|               | GPT-4 Turbo           |\n|               | GPT-4                 |\n|               | GPT-3.5 Turbo         |\n| **Anthropic** | Claude Sonnet 4       |\n|               | Claude 3.5 Sonnet     |\n|               | Claude 3.5 Sonnet v1  |\n|               | Claude 3.7 Sonnet     |\n|               | Claude 3.0 Haiku      |\n\nUsing your own Custom LLM is also supported by specifying the endpoint we should make requests to and providing credentials through our secure secret storage.\n\n![Supported models](/assets/images/conversational-ai/llms.png)\n\nYou can start with our [free tier](https://elevenlabs.io/app/sign-up), which includes 15 minutes of conversation per month.\n\nNeed more?

      "content": "---\ntitle: Post-call webhooks\nsubtitle: Get notified when calls end and analysis is complete through webhooks.\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nPost-call [Webhooks](/docs/product-guides/administration/webhooks) allow you to receive detailed information about a call after analysis is complete. When enabled, ElevenLabs will send a POST request to your specified endpoint with comprehensive call data, including transcripts, analysis results, and metadata.\nThe data that is returned is the same data that is returned from the [Conversation API](/docs/conversational-ai/api-reference/conversations/get-conversations).\n\n## Enabling post-call webhooks\n\nPost-call webhooks can be enabled for all agents in your workspace through the Conversational AI [settings page](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/settings).\n\n<Frame background=\"subtle\">\n  ![Post-call webhook settings](/assets/images/conversational-ai/postcallwebhooksettings.png)\n</Frame>\n\n<Warning>\n  Post call webhooks must return a 200 status code to be considered successful. Webhooks that\n  repeatedly fail are auto disabled if there are 10 or more consecutive failures and the last\n  successful delivery was more than 7 days ago or has never been successfully delivered.\n</Warning>\n\n<Note>For HIPAA compliance, if a webhook fails we can not retry the webhook.</Note>\n\n### Authentication\n\n<Markdown src=\"/snippets/webhook-hmac-authentication.mdx\" />\n\n### IP whitelisting\n\nFor additional security, you can whitelist the following static egress IPs from which all ElevenLabs webhook requests originate:\n\n| Region       | IP Address     |\n| ------------ | -------------- |\n| US (Default) | 34.67.146.145  |\n| US (Default) | 34.59.11.47    |\n| EU           | 35.204.38.71   |\n| EU           | 34.147.113.54  |\n| Asia         | 35.185.187.110 |\n| Asia         | 35.247.157.189 |\n\nIf your infrastructure requires strict IP-based access controls, adding these IPs to your firewall allowlist will ensure you only receive webhook requests from ElevenLabs' systems.\n\n<Note>\n  These static IPs are used across all ElevenLabs webhook services and will remain consistent. Using\n  IP whitelisting in combination with HMAC signature validation provides multiple layers of\n  security.\n</Note>\n\n## Webhook response structure\n\nThe webhook payload contains the same data you would receive from a GET request to the Conversation API endpoint, with additional fields for event timing and type information.\n\n### Top-level fields\n\n| Field             | Type   | Description                                                    |\n| ----------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `type`            | string | Type of event (always `post_call_transcription` in this case)  |\n| `data`            | object | Data for the conversation, what would be returned from the API |\n| `event_timestamp` | number | When this event occurred in unix time UTC                      |\n\n## Example webhook payload\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"post_call_transcription\",\n  \"event_timestamp\": 1739537297,\n  \"data\": {\n    \"agent_id\": \"xyz\",\n    \"conversation_id\": \"abc\",\n    \"status\": \"done\",\n    \"transcript\": [\n      {\n        \"role\": \"agent\",\n        \"message\": \"Hey there angelo.

Here are some practical applications:\n\n#### CRM integration\n\nUpdate your customer relationship management system with conversation data as soon as a call completes:\n\n```javascript\n// Example webhook handler\napp.post('/webhook/elevenlabs', async (req, res) => {\n  // HMAC validation code\n\n  const { data } = req.body;\n\n  // Extract key information\n  const userId = data.metadata.user_id;\n  const transcriptSummary = data.analysis.transcript_summary;\n  const callSuccessful = data.analysis.call_successful;\n\n  // Update CRM record\n  await updateCustomerRecord(userId, {\n    lastInteraction: new Date(),\n    conversationSummary: transcriptSummary,\n    callOutcome: callSuccessful,\n    fullTranscript: data.transcript,\n  });\n\n  res.status(200).send('Webhook received');\n});\n```\n\n### Stateful conversations\n\nMaintain conversation context across multiple interactions by storing and retrieving state:\n\n1. When a call starts, pass in your user id as a dynamic variable.\n2. When a call ends, set up your webhook endpoint to store conversation data in your database, based on the extracted user id from the dynamic_variables.\n3. When the user calls again, you can retrieve this context and pass it to the new conversation into a {{previous_topics}} dynamic variable.\n4. This creates a seamless experience where the agent \"remembers\" previous interactions\n\n```javascript\n// Store conversation state when call ends\napp.post('/webhook/elevenlabs', async (req, res) => {\n  // HMAC validation code\n\n  const { data } = req.body;\n  const userId = data.metadata.user_id;\n\n  // Store conversation state\n  await db.userStates.upsert({\n    userId,\n    lastConversationId: data.conversation_id,\n    lastInteractionTimestamp: data.metadata.start_time_unix_secs,\n    conversationHistory: data.transcript,\n    previousTopics: extractTopics(data.analysis.transcript_summary),\n  });\n\n  res.status(200).send('Webhook received');\n});\n\n// When initiating a new call, retrieve and use the state\nasync function initiateCall(userId) {\n  // Get user's conversation state\n  const userState = await db.userStates.findOne({ userId });\n\n  // Start new conversation with context from previous calls\n  return await elevenlabs.startConversation({\n    agent_id: 'xyz',\n    conversation_id: generateNewId(),\n    dynamic_variables: {\n      user_name: userState.name,\n      previous_conversation_id: userState.lastConversationId,\n      previous_topics: userState.previousTopics.join(', '),\n    },\n  });\n}\n```\n",
